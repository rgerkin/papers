	abstract = {Visual imagery during sleep has long been a topic of persistent speculation, but its private nature has hampered objective analysis. Here, we present a neural decoding approach in which machine learning models predict the contents of visual imagery during the sleep onset period given measured brain activity, by discovering links between human {fMRI} patterns and verbal reports with the assistance of lexical and image databases. Decoding models trained on stimulus-induced brain activity in visual cortical areas showed accurate classification, detection, and identification of contents. Our findings demonstrate that specific visual experience during sleep is represented by brain activity patterns shared by stimulus perception, providing a means to uncover subjective contents of dreaming using objective neural measurement.},

	issn = {0306-4522},
	abstract = {Acetylcholine has long been known to play an important role in the cortical activation that accompanies the states of wakefulness and paradoxical sleep (for review, see Refs 17, 21) when this neurotransmitter is released from the cerebral cortex at the highest rates. The major supply of acetylcholine to the cerebral cortex arises from the cholinergic neurons of Meynert's Basal-ganglion or nucleus basalis of the forebrain. Lying in the substantia innominata within the major ascending pathway from the brain stem reticular formation, magnocellular basalis neurons project upon the cerebral cortex as the important ventral, extrathalamic relay of the ascending reticular activating system. Although the cholinergic basalis nucleus neurons have been shown to be important for cortical activation, the precise manner in which they influence cortical activity has not as yet been elucidated, in part because the cholinergic cells of this nucleus have not been identified in electrophysiological studies. Using intracellular recording in guinea-pig brain slices, we were able to record and fill with biocytin nucleus basalis neurons which were subsequently revealed by immunohistochemical staining to be choline acetyltransferase-positive and thus cholinergic. The cholinergic cells displayed rhythmic bursting activity mediated by a low-threshold calcium spike in vitro, which would endow them with a capacity for phasic (in addition to tonic) firing in vivo. By virtue of these different modes, cholinergic basalis neurons may accordingly deter or facilitate the cortical response to sensory input and may furthermore modulate the major frequencies of cortical activity across the different states of the sleep-waking cycle.},

In this study, we used a nonlinear technique to compute the {RFs} of complex cells from their responses to natural images. We found that each {RF} is well described by a small number of subunits, which are oriented, localized, and bandpass. These subunits contribute to neuronal responses in a contrast-dependent, polarity-invariant manner, and they can largely predict the orientation and spatial frequency tuning of the cell. Although the {RF} structures measured with natural images were similar to those measured with random stimuli, natural images were more effective for driving complex cells, thus facilitating rapid identification of the subunits. The subunit {RF} model provides a useful basis for understanding cortical processing of natural stimuli.},

In recent years, correlated noise-induced synchronization has received support from many theoretical and experimental studies. However, many of these prior studies have assumed that neurons have identical biophysical properties and that their inputs are well modeled by white noise. In this context, we use colored noise to induce synchronization between oscillators with heterogeneity in both phase-response curves and frequencies. In the low noise limit, we derive novel analytical theory showing that the time constant of colored noise influences correlated noise-induced synchronization and that oscillator heterogeneity can limit synchronization. Surprisingly, however, heterogeneous oscillators may synchronize better than homogeneous oscillators given low input correlations. We also find resonance of oscillator synchronization to colored noise inputs when firing frequencies diverge. Collectively, these results prove robust for both relatively high noise regimes and when applied to biophysically realistic spiking neuron models, and further match experimental recordings from acute brain slices.},

A standard framework for neuroscience data is needed to bridge existing digital data resources and to help in the conceptual unification of the multiple disciplines of neuroscience. Using our efforts in building ontologies for neuroscience as an example, we examine the benefits and limits of ontologies as a solution for this data integration problem.

It has been suggested that sensory systems might have evolved highly efficient coding strategies to maximize the information conveyed to the brain while minimizing the required energy and neural resources. Here we show that, for natural sounds, the complete acoustic waveform can be represented efficiently with a nonlinear model based on a population spike code. In this model, idealized spikes encode the precise temporal positions and magnitudes of underlying acoustic features. We find that when the features are optimized for coding either natural sounds or speech, they show striking similarities to time-domain cochlear filter estimates, have a frequency-bandwidth dependence similar to that of auditory nerve fibres, and yield significantly greater coding efficiency than conventional signal representations. These results indicate that the auditory code might approach an information theoretic optimum and that the acoustic structure of speech might be adapted to the coding capacity of the mammalian auditory system.},

It has also been proposed that neurons convey the most information about stimuli in the flanks of their tuning curves, where firing rate changes most steeply. Here we demonstrate that the responses of rat auditory cortical neurons convey maximal stimulus-specific information about sound frequency at their best frequency, rather than in the flanks of their tuning curves. Theoretical work has shown that stimulus-specific information shifts from tuning curve slope to peak as neuronal variability increases. These results therefore suggest that with respect to the most informative regions of the tuning curve, auditory cortical neurons operate in a regime of high variability.},

Unreacted primer is specifically eliminated by exonuclease treatment and second strands are generated with a second poly({dT)-tailed} primer after poly({dA)} tailing of the first-strand {cDNAs.} The {cDNAs} are split into four tubes, which are independently directionally amplified by {PCR}, and then recombined. The amplified products (approximately 100 ng) show superior representation and reproducibility of original gene expression, especially for genes expressed in more than 20 copies per cell, compared with those obtained by a conventional {PCR} protocol, and can effectively be used for quantitative {PCR} and {EST} analyses. The {cDNAs} are then subjected to another {PCR} amplification with primers bearing the T7 promoter sequence. The resultant {cDNA} products are gel purified, amplified by one final cycle and used for isothermal linear amplification by T7 {RNA} polymerase to synthesize {cRNAs} for microarray hybridization. This protocol yields {cDNA} templates sufficient for more than 80 microarray hybridizations from a single cell, and can be completed in 5-6 days.},

We investigated how photoreceptor types contribute to the attractiveness of light by blocking the function of certain subsets and by measuring differential phototaxis between spectrally different lights. In a {“UV} vs. blue” choice, flies with only {R1–R6}, as well as flies with only {R7/R8} photoreceptors, preferred blue, suggesting a nonadditive interaction between the two major subsystems.

	abstract = {Biophysically accurate multicompartmental models of individual neurons have significantly advanced our understanding of the input-output function of single cells. These models depend on a large number of parameters that are difficult to estimate. In practice, they are often hand-tuned to match measured physiological behaviors, thus raising questions of identifiability and interpretability. We propose a statistical approach to the automatic estimation of various biologically relevant parameters, including 1) the distribution of channel densities, 2) the spatiotemporal pattern of synaptic input, and 3) axial resistances across extended dendrites. Recent experimental advances, notably in voltage-sensitive imaging, motivate us to assume access to: i) the spatiotemporal voltage signal in the dendrite and ii) an approximate description of the channel kinetics of interest. We show here that, given i and ii, parameters 1-3 can be inferred simultaneously by nonnegative linear regression; that this optimization problem possesses a unique solution and is guaranteed to converge despite the large number of parameters and their complex nonlinear interaction; and that standard optimization algorithms efficiently reach this optimum with modest computational and data requirements. We demonstrate that the method leads to accurate estimations on a wide variety of challenging model data sets that include up to about 104 parameters (roughly two orders of magnitude more than previously feasible) and describe how the method gives insights into the functional interaction of groups of channels.},

	abstract = {Theoretical and experimental studies of distributed neuronal representations of sensory and behavioral variables usually assume that the tuning of the mean firing rates is the main source of information. However, recent theoretical studies have investigated the effect of cross-correlations in the trial-to-trial fluctuations of the neuronal responses on the accuracy of the representation. Assuming that only the first-order statistics of the neuronal responses are tuned to the stimulus, these studies have shown that in the presence of correlations, similar to those observed experimentally in cortical ensembles of neurons, the amount of information in the population is limited, yielding nonzero error levels even in the limit of infinitely large populations of neurons. In this letter, we study correlated neuronal populations whose higher-order statistics, and in particular response variances, are also modulated by the stimulus. Weask two questions: Does the correlated noise limit the accuracy of the neuronal representation of the stimulus? and, How can a biological mechanism extract most of the information embedded in the higher-order statistics of the neuronal responses? Specifically, we address these questions in the context of a population of neurons coding an angular variable. We show that the information embedded in the variances grows linearly with the population size despite the presence of strong correlated noise. This information cannot be extracted by linear readout schemes, including the linear population vector. Instead, we propose a bilinear readout scheme that involves spatial decorrelation, quadratic nonlinearity, and population vector summation. We show that this nonlinear population vector scheme yields accurate estimates of stimulus parameters, with an efficiency that grows linearly with the population size. This code can be implemented using biologically plausible neurons.},

Characterization studies   showed a small maximum h-conductance (2.6 +/- 0.3 {nS}, n=11), shallow   voltage dependence with a hyperpolarized half-maximal activation   (V(1/2)=-91 {mV)}, and kinetics characterized by double-exponential   functions. The functional consequences of I(h) were examined with regard   to temporal summation and impedance measurements. For temporal summation   experiments, 5-pulse mossy fiber input trains were activated. Blocking   I(h) with 50 mu M {ZD7288} resulted in an increase in temporal summation,   suggesting that I(h) supports sensitivity of response amplitude to   relative input timing. Impedance was assessed by applying sinusoidal   current commands. From impedance measurements, we found that I(h) did   not confer theta-band resonance, but flattened the impedance-frequency   relations instead. Double immunolabeling for hyperpolarization-activated   cyclic nucleotide-gated proteins and glutamate decarboxylase 67 suggests   that all four subunits are present in {GABAergic} interneurons from the   strata considered for electrophysiological studies. Finally, a model of   I(h) was employed in computational analyses to confirm and elaborate   upon the contributions of I(h) to impedance and temporal summation.},

	abstract = {The electrical diversity of neurons arises from the expression of different combinations of ion channels. The gene expression rules governing these combinations are not known. We examined the expression of twenty-six ion channel genes in a broad range of single neocortical neuron cell types. Using expression data from a subset of twenty-six ion channel genes in ten different neocortical neuronal types, classified according to their electrophysiological properties, morphologies and anatomical positions, we first developed an incremental Support Vector Machine ({iSVM)} model that prioritizes the predictive value of single and combinations of genes for the rest of the expression pattern. With this approach we could predict the expression patterns for the ten neuronal types with an average 10-fold cross validation accuracy of 87\% and for a further fourteen neuronal types not used in building the model, with an average accuracy of 75\%. The expression of the genes for {HCN4}, Kv2.2, Kv3.2 and Caβ3 were found to be particularly strong predictors of ion channel gene combinations, while expression of the Kv1.4 and Kv3.3 genes has no predictive value. Using a logic gate analysis, we then extracted a spectrum of observed combinatorial gene expression rules of twenty ion channels in different neocortical neurons. We also show that when applied to a completely random and independent data, the model could not extract any rules and that it is only possible to extract them if the data has consistent expression patterns. This novel strategy can be used for predictive reverse engineering combinatorial expression rules from single-cell data and could help identify candidate transcription regulatory processes.},

Partnered with the Society, its Neuroinformatics Committee, and volunteer consultant-collaborators, our multi-site consortium has developed: (1) a comprehensive, dynamic, inventory of Web-accessible neuroscience resources, (2) an extended and integrated terminology describing resources and contents, and (3) a framework accepting and aiding concept-based queries. Evolving instantiations of the Framework may be viewed at http://nif.nih.gov , http://neurogateway.org , and other sites as they come on line.},

In an unsupervised phase, we learn a hierarchy of features from data, and in a supervised phase, we learn how brain activity predicts the states of those features. Reconstruction is achieved by sampling from the model, conditioned on brain activity. We show that by using the hierarchical generative model, we can obtain good-quality reconstructions of visual images of handwritten digits presented during an {fMRI} scanning session.},

Two related approaches--decoding and information theory--can be used to extract single-trial information from the activity of neuronal populations. Such population analysis can give us more information about how neurons encode stimulus features than traditional single-cell studies.},

White noise stimulus and reverse correlation (the spike-triggered average and spike-triggered covariance) are often used in experimental neuroscience to "ask" neurons which dimensions in stimulus space they are sensitive to and to characterize the nonlinearity of the response. In this article, we apply reverse correlation to the simplest model neuron with temporal dynamics-the leaky integrate-and-fire model-and find that for even this simple case, standard techniques do not recover the known neural computation. To overcome this, we develop novel reverse-correlation techniques by selectively analyzing only "isolated" spikes and taking explicit account of the extended silences that precede these isolated spikes. We discuss the implications of our methods to the characterization of neural adaptation. Although these methods are developed in the context of the leaky integrate-and-fire model, our findings are relevant for the analysis of spike trains from real neurons.},

The application of this approach to schizophrenia-associated genetic variations, obtained using unbiased whole-genome methods, allowed us to identify several cohesive gene networks related to axon guidance, neuronal cell mobility, synaptic function and chromosomal remodeling. The genes forming the networks are highly expressed in the brain, with higher brain expression during prenatal development. The identified networks are functionally related to genes previously implicated in schizophrenia, autism and intellectual disability. A comparative analysis of copy number variants associated with autism and schizophrenia suggests that although the molecular networks implicated in these distinct disorders may be related, the mutations associated with each disease are likely to lead, at least on average, to different functional consequences.},

We examined the expression of twenty-six ion channel genes in a broad range of single neocortical neuron cell types. Using expression data from a subset of twenty-six ion channel genes in ten different neocortical neuronal types, classified according to their electrophysiological properties, morphologies and anatomical positions, we first developed an incremental Support Vector Machine ({iSVM)} model that prioritizes the predictive value of single and combinations of genes for the rest of the expression pattern. With this approach we could predict the expression patterns for the ten neuronal types with an average 10-fold cross validation accuracy of 87\% and for a further fourteen neuronal types not used in building the model, with an average accuracy of 75\%. The expression of the genes for {HCN4}, Kv2.2, Kv3.2 and Caβ3 were found to be particularly strong predictors of ion channel gene combinations, while expression of the Kv1.4 and Kv3.3 genes has no predictive value. Using a logic gate analysis, we then extracted a spectrum of observed combinatorial gene expression rules of twenty ion channels in different neocortical neurons. We also show that when applied to a completely random and independent data, the model could not extract any rules and that it is only possible to extract them if the data has consistent expression patterns. This novel strategy can be used for predictive reverse engineering combinatorial expression rules from single-cell data and could help identify candidate transcription regulatory processes.},

The interspike interval distribution of first-passage time is shown to satisfy a Volterra integral equation suitable for numerical evaluation. Explicit solutions as well as their Laplace (Mellin) transforms are obtained for some special cases. The main technique used in this paper is the extension of Wald's fundamental identity of sequential analysis to a wide range of additive stochastic processes with an (eventually) linear boundary function. This identity is also useful in evaluating model parameters in terms of observed firing times, as well as providing a unified exposition of many earlier results.},

It is very obvious that we have very many different kinds of smells, all the way from the odor of violets and roses up to asafetida. But until you can measure their likenesses and differences you can have no science of odor.” Here we developed a computational framework and algorithm that looks at the molecular structure of two odors and predicts their ensuing perceptual similarity. Importantly, the algorithm works for odors that are each composed of a mixture containing tens of different molecules, much like natural smells. The algorithm that worked best was one that treats the odor-mixture as a single value, rather than a bunch of values reflecting each of its components. This is consistent with the growing view of how the mammalian brain treats odors: synthesizing a singular odor percept rather than analytically extracting individual odorant features from the odor-mixture. In conclusion, our algorithm's performance may contribute to the practice of the science of odor, and our algorithm's nature may contribute to the understanding of brain mechanisms of smell.},

We show that activity of these interneurons evolves slowly in time but that individual neurons fire at reliable times, with a timescale similar to the slow changes in the patterns of odor-evoked activity and to odor discrimination. Most strikingly, the latency of a single granule cell is highly reliable from trial to trial during repeated stimulation of the same glomerulus, whereas this same cell will have a markedly different latency when a different glomerulus is activated. These data suggest that the timing of granule cell-mediated inhibition in the olfactory bulb is tightly regulated by the source of input and that inhibition may contribute to the generation of reliable temporal patterns of mitral cell activity.},

	abstract = {The recording radius and spatial selectivity of an extracellular probe are important for interpreting neurophysiological recordings but are rarely measured. Moreover, an analysis of the recording biophysics of multisite probes (e.g., tetrodes) can provide for source characterization and localization of spiking single units, but this capability has remained largely unexploited. Here we address both issues quantitatively. Advancing a tetrode (≈40-μm contact separation, tetrahedral geometry) in 5- to 10-μm steps, we repeatedly recorded extracellular action potentials ({EAPs)} of single neurons in the visual cortex. Using measured spatial variation of {EAPs}, the tetrodes' measured geometry, and a volume conductor model of the cortical tissue, we solved the inverse problem of estimating the location and the size of the equivalent dipole model of the spike generator associated with each neuron. Half of the 61 visual neurons were localized within a radius of ≈100 μm and 95\% within ≈130 μm around the tetrode tip (i.e., a large fraction was much further than previously thought). Because of the combined angular sensitivity of the tetrode's leads, location uncertainty was less than one-half the cell's distance. We quantified the spatial dependence of the probability of cell isolation, the isolated fraction, and the dependence of the recording radius on probe size and equivalent dipole size. We also reconstructed the spatial configuration of sets of simultaneously recorded neurons to demonstrate the potential use of {3D} dipole localization for functional anatomy. Finally, we found that the dipole moment vector, surprisingly, tended to point toward the probe, leading to the interpretation that the equivalent dipole represents a “local lobe” of the dendritic arbor.},

Electrosensory pyramidal cells have a well defined backpropagation-dependent burst mechanism. We used in vivo, in vitro, and modeling approaches to investigate pyramidal cell responses to mimics of behaviorally relevant sensory input. We found that within a given spike train, bursts are biased toward low-frequency events while isolated spikes simultaneously code for the entire frequency range. We also demonstrated that burst dynamics are essential for optimal feature detection but are not required for stimulus estimation.

We assessed whether proposed changes widened or narrowed disease definitions, rationales offered, mention of potential harms of those changes, and the nature and extent of disclosed ties between members and pharmaceutical or device {companies.Of} 16 publications on 14 common conditions, ten proposed changes widening and one narrowing definitions. For five, impact was unclear. Widening fell into three categories: creating “pre-disease”; lowering diagnostic thresholds; and proposing earlier or different diagnostic methods. Rationales included standardising diagnostic criteria and new evidence about risks for people previously considered to not have the disease. No publication included rigorous assessment of potential harms of proposed {changes.Among} 14 panels with disclosures, the average proportion of members with industry ties was 75\%. Twelve were chaired by people with ties. For members with ties, the median number of companies to which they had ties was seven.

The efficacy of inhibition and thus neuronal excitability is critically dependent on the accumulation of specific {GABA(A)R} subtypes at inhibitory synapses.

We developed chronically implanted multitetrode arrays offering unprecedented recording quality to reexamine this question in the primary visual cortex of awake macaques.

We applied pattern classification techniques to characterize patterns of activity coding object-centered side, a task-defined variable specifying whether an object component was located on the left or right side of a reference object, regardless of its retinocentric position. During a period in which the value of object-centered side, as defined by task events, remained constant, parietal cortex represented this variable using a dynamic neural code by activating neurons with the same spatial preference in rapid succession so that the pattern of active neurons changed dramatically while the spatial information they collectively encoded remained stable. Furthermore, if the neurons shared the same spatial preference, then their pretrial activity (measured before objects were shown) was correlated to a degree that scaled as a positive linear function of how close together in time the neurons would be activated later in the trial. Finally, we found that while parietal cortex represented task-critical spatial information using a dynamic neural code, it simultaneously represented task-irrelevant spatial information using a stationary neural code. These data demonstrate that dynamic spatial representations exist in parietal cortex, provide novel insight into the synaptic mechanisms that generate them, and suggest they may preferentially encode task-critical spatial information.},

In vitro electrical recordings from these neurons have revealed a correspondingly diverse range of intrinsic firing patterns, including non-adapting, adapting and bursting types. This heterogeneity of electrical responsivity has generally been attributed to variability in the types and densities of ionic channels. We show here, using compartmental models of reconstructed cortical neurons, that an entire spectrum of firing patterns can be reproduced in a set of neurons that share a common distribution of ion channels and differ only in their dendritic geometry. The essential behaviour of the model depends on partial electrical coupling of fast active conductances localized to the soma and axon and slow active currents located throughout the dendrites, and can be reproduced in a two-compartment model. The results suggest a causal relationship for the observed correlations between dendritic structure and firing properties and emphasize the importance of active dendritic conductances in neuronal function.},

	abstract = {1. Detailed compartmental computer simulations of single mitral and granule cells of the vertebrate olfactory bulb were constructed using previously published geometric data. Electrophysiological properties were determined by comparing model output to previously published experimental data, mainly current-clamp recordings. 2. The passive electrical properties of each model were explored by comparing model output with intracellular potential data from hyperpolarizing current injection experiments. The results suggest that membrane resistivity in both cells is nonuniform, with somatas having a substantially lower resistivity than the dendrites. 3. The active properties of these cells were explored by incorporating active ion channels into modeled compartments. On the basis of evidence from the literature, the mitral cell model included six channel types: fast sodium, fast delayed rectifier (Kfast), slow delayed rectifier (K), transient outward potassium current ({KA)}, voltage- and calcium-dependent potassium current ({KCa)}, and L-type calcium current. The granule cell model included four channel types: rat brain sodium, K, {KA}, and the non-inactivating muscarinic potassium current ({KM).} Modeled channels were based on the Hodgkin-Huxley formalism. 4. Representative kinetics for each of the channel classes above were obtained from the literature. The experimentally unknown spatial distributions of each included channel were obtained by systematic parameter searches. These were conducted in two ways: large-scale simulation series, in which each parameter was varied in turn, and an adaptation of a multidimensional conjugate gradient method. In each case, the simulated results were compared wtih experimental data using a curve-matching function evaluating mean squared differences of several aspects of the simulated and experimental voltage waveforms. 5. Systematic parameter variations revealed a single distinct region of parameter space in which the mitral cell model best fit the data. This region of parameter space was also very robust to parameter variations. Specifically, optimum performance was obtained when calcium and slow K channels were concentrated in the glomeruli, with a lower density in the soma and proximal secondary dendrites. The distribution of sodium and fast potassium channels, on the other hand, was highest at the soma and axon, with a much lighter distribution throughout the secondary dendrites. The {KA} and {KCa} channels were also concentrated near the soma. 6. The parameter search of the granule cell model was much less restrained by experimental data. Several parameter regimes were found that gave a good match to the data.({ABSTRACT} {TRUNCATED} {AT} 400 {WORDS)}},

	abstract = {Encoding time is universally required for learning and structuring motor and cognitive actions, but how the brain keeps track of time is still not understood. We searched for time representations in cortico-basal ganglia circuits by recording from thousands of neurons in the prefrontal cortex and striatum of macaque monkeys performing a routine visuomotor task. We found that a subset of neurons exhibited time-stamp encoding strikingly similar to that required by models of reinforcement-based learning: They responded with spike activity peaks that were distributed at different time delays after single task events. Moreover, the temporal evolution of the population activity allowed robust decoding of task time by perceptron models. We suggest that time information can emerge as a byproduct of event coding in cortico-basal ganglia circuits and can serve as a critical infrastructure for behavioral learning and performance.},

	abstract = {The postdevelopmental basis of cellular identity and the unique cellular output of a particular neuron type are of particular interest in the nervous system because a detailed understanding of circuits responsible for complex processes in the brain is impeded by the often ambiguous classification of neurons in these circuits. Neurons have been classified by morphological, electrophysiological, and neurochemical techniques. More recently, molecular approaches, particularly microarray, have been applied to the question of neuronal identity. With the realization that proteins expressed exclusively in only one type of neuron are rare, expression profiles obtained from neuronal subtypes are analyzed to search for diagnostic patterns of gene expression. However, this expression profiling hinges on one critical and implicit assumption: that neurons of the same type in different animals achieve their conserved functional output via conserved levels and quantitative relationships of gene expression. Here we exploit the unambiguously identifiable neurons in the crab stomatogastric ganglion to investigate the precise quantitative expression profiling of neurons at the level of single-cell ion channel expression. By measuring absolute {mRNA} levels of six different channels in the same individually identified neurons, we demonstrate that not only do individual cell types possess highly variable levels of channel expression but that this variability is constrained by unique patterns of correlated channel expression.},

We describe the maximum likelihood estimator for the model parameters, given only extracellular spike train responses (not intracellular voltage data). Specifically, we prove that the log-likelihood function is concave and thus has an essentially unique global maximum that can be found using gradient ascent techniques. We develop an efficient algorithm for computing the maximum likelihood solution, demonstrate the effectiveness of the resulting estimator with numerical simulations, and discuss a method of testing the model's validity using time-rescaling and density evolution techniques.},

	abstract = {Social behaviours in species as diverse as honey bees and humans promote group survival but often come at some cost to the individual. Although reinforcement of adaptive social interactions is ostensibly required for the evolutionary persistence of these behaviours, the neural mechanisms by which social reward is encoded by the brain are largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that in mice oxytocin acts as a social reinforcement signal within the nucleus accumbens core, where it elicits a presynaptically expressed long-term depression of excitatory synaptic transmission in medium spiny neurons. Although the nucleus accumbens receives oxytocin-receptor-containing inputs from several brain regions, genetic deletion of these receptors specifically from dorsal raphe nucleus, which provides serotonergic (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-{HT)} innervation to the nucleus accumbens, abolishes the reinforcing properties of social interaction. Furthermore, oxytocin-induced synaptic plasticity requires activation of nucleus accumbens 5-{HT1B} receptors, the blockade of which prevents social reward. These results demonstrate that the rewarding properties of social interaction in mice require the coordinated activity of oxytocin and 5-{HT} in the nucleus accumbens, a mechanistic insight with implications for understanding the pathogenesis of social dysfunction in neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism.},

	abstract = {Few studies have investigated how the cortex encodes the preshaping of the hand as an object is grasped, an ethological movement referred to as prehension. We developed an encoding model of hand kinematics to test whether primary motor cortex ({MI)} neurons encode temporally extensive combinations of joint motions that characterize a prehensile movement. Two female rhesus macaque monkeys were trained to grasp 4 different objects presented by a robot while their arm was held in place by a thermoplastic brace. We used multielectrode arrays to record {MI} neurons and an infrared camera motion tracking system to record the 3-D positions of 14 markers placed on the monkeys' wrist and digits. A generalized linear model framework was used to predict the firing rate of each neuron in a 4 ms time interval, based on its own spiking history and the spatiotemporal kinematics of the joint angles of the hand. Our results show that the variability of the firing rate of {MI} neurons is better described by temporally extensive combinations of finger and wrist joint angle kinematics rather than any individual joint motion or any combination of static kinematic parameters at their optimal lag. Moreover, a higher percentage of neurons encoded joint angular velocities than joint angular positions. These results suggest that neurons encode the covarying trajectories of the hand's joints during a prehensile movement.},

	abstract = {We now know of a surprising number of cases where single neurons contain multiple neurotransmitters. Neurons that contain a fast-acting neurotransmitter, such as glutamate or {GABA}, and a modulatory transmitter, such as dopamine, are a particularly interesting case because they presumably serve dual signaling functions. The olfactory bulb contains a large population of {GABA-} and dopamine-containing neurons that have been implicated in normal olfaction as well as in Parkinson's disease. Yet, they have been classified as nonexocytotic catecholamine neurons because of the apparent lack of vesicular monoamine transporters. Thus, we examined how dopamine is stored and released from tyrosine hydroxylase-positive {GFP} ({TH+-GFP)} mouse periglomerular neurons in vitro. {TH+} cells expressed both {VMAT2} (vesicular monoamine transporter 2) and {VGAT} (vesicular {GABA} transporter), consistent with vesicular storage of both dopamine and {GABA.} Carbon fiber amperometry revealed that release of dopamine was quantal and calcium-dependent, but quantal size was much less than expected for large dense core vesicles, suggesting that release originated from small clear vesicles identified by electron microscopy. A single action potential in a {TH+} neuron evoked a brief {GABA-mediated} synaptic current, whereas evoked dopamine release was asynchronous, lasting for tens of seconds. Our data suggest that dopamine and {GABA} serve temporally distinct roles in these dual transmitter neurons.},

	volume = {70},
	url = {http://ep.physoc.org/content/70/2/189.abstract},
	abstract = {Intracellular recordings were made from {CA1} and {CA3} pyramidal cells and from dentate granule cells of the mouse hippocampal slice preparation. The passive electrical properties of the cells and their responses to electrical stimulation of the major antidromic and orthodromic pathways were explored. The majority of cells were impaled between 60 and 100 µm from the surface of the slice. Mean resting potentials were about -66 {mV} for dentate and {CA1} cells and -61 {mV} for {CA3} cells. Mean input resistances were 87, 78 and 73 MΩ respectively, with a range of 30-160 MΩ for all three populations. Action potential amplitudes ranged from 70 to 1 10 {mV} and were typically about 90 {mV.} Current-voltage (I-V) plots for all three populations were ohmic within a range 10-20 {mV} negative to the resting potentials. The chord resistance of the I-V relation was lower at more negative potentials and higher at more positive potentials than at the resting potential. Antidromic stimulation at intensities subthreshold for action potential invasion of the impaled cell gave rise to inhibitory post-synaptic potentials (i.p.s.p.s) in {CA1} and {CA3} cells. The reversal potential of the i.p.s.p.s lay between -65 and -75 {mV.} They were chloride dependent and could be attenuated by application of bicuculline methiodide. No recurrent i.p.s.p. was seen in dentate cells when using potassium-acetate-filled electrodes. If potassium-chloride-filled intracellular electrodes were used, thus raising the intracellular chloride ion concentration, an antidromically evoked, bicuculline-sensitive depolarizing post-synaptic potential (p.s.p.) could be evoked. Thus, a γ-aminobutyric acid ({GABA)-mediated} recurrent inhibitory pathway was present in the slice in all three cell populations but appeared to be difficult to evoke reliably in the dentate gyrus. Orthodromic excitation of {CA1} and {CA3} cells evoked an excitatory post-synaptic potential (e.p.s.p.) followed by a biphasic hyperpolarization. The early hyperpolarization, lasting about 50 ms, reversed at about -65 {mV} and was chloride dependent. The later hyperpolarization lasted up to 400 ms, reversed at about -85 {mV}, and was chloride independent. The e.p.s.p. evoked in dentate cells by stimulation of the perforant path was biphasic and was followed by a hyperpolarization lasting 300-600 ms. The hyperpolarization resembled the late hyperpolarization described above. The two components of the e.p.s.p. may have been produced by the combined activation of the medial and lateral components of the perforant path. Small-amplitude regenerative potentials have been seen in all three cell types. They were generally from 5 to 10 {mV} in amplitude, compared to initial segment action potentials which were 30-40 {mV} in amplitude. They occurred in association with membrane depolarizations however produced, i.e. on evoked e.p.s.p.s, on spontaneous e.p.s.p.s or on the reversed (depolarizing) spontaneous i.p.s.p.s seen in cells impaled with electrodes filled with potassium chloride. They were sometimes also evoked by the passage of depolarizing current through the cells. They were always more readily seen if the cells were hyperpolarized. These observations suggest that these events were produced by a mechanism intrinsic to the cell membrane, rather than representing electrotonic spread of action potentials from nearby cells through electrical synapses. {CA3} cells showed a characteristic pattern of spontaneous activity, discharging action potentials in bursts associated with spontaneous membrane depolarizations of 5-20 {mV.} These were followed by after-potentials which reversed at about -85 {mV.} The after-potentials were associated with a fall in input resistance and were not affected by changes in intracellular chloride. Spontaneous depolarizing bicuculline-sensitive p.s.p.s were seen in all three cell populations when cells were impaled with electrodes filled with potassium chloride. This shows that interneurones utilizing {GABA} as a neurotransmitter are spontaneously active in the slice preparation.},

	abstract = {Measuring agreement between a statistical model and a spike train data series, that is, evaluating goodness of fit, is crucial for establishing the model's validity prior to using it to make inferences about a particular neural system. Assessing goodness-of-fit is a challenging problem for point process neural spike train models, especially for histogram-based models such as perstimulus time histograms ({PSTH)} and rate functions estimated by spike train smoothing. The time-rescaling theorem is a well-known result in probability theory, which states that any point process with an integrable conditional intensity function may be transformed into a Poisson process with unit rate. We describe how the theorem may be used to develop goodness-of-fit tests for both parametric and histogram-based point process models of neural spike trains. We apply these tests in two examples: a comparison of {PSTH}, inhomogeneous Poisson, and inhomogeneous Markov interval models of neural spike trains from the supplementary eye field of a macque monkey and a comparison of temporal and spatial smoothers, inhomogeneous Poisson, inhomogeneous gamma, and inhomogeneous inverse gaussian models of rat hippocampal place cell spiking activity. To help make the logic behind the time-rescaling theorem more accessible to researchers in neuroscience, we present a proof using only elementary probability theory {arguments.We} also show how the theorem may be used to simulate a general point process model of a spike train. Our paradigm makes it possible to compare parametric and histogram-based neural spike train models directly. These results suggest that the time-rescaling theorem can be a valuable tool for neural spike train data analysis.},

With the rise of complex systems research, multivariate information measures have been increasingly used to investigate interactions between groups of three or more variables, often with an emphasis on so called synergistic and redundant interactions. While bivariate information measures are commonly agreed upon, the multivariate information measures in use today have been developed by many different groups, and differ in subtle, yet significant ways. Here, we will review these multivariate information measures with special emphasis paid to their relationship to synergy and redundancy, as well as examine the differences between these measures by applying them to several simple model systems. In addition to these systems, we will illustrate the usefulness of the information measures by analyzing neural spiking data from a dissociated culture through early stages of its development. Our aim is that this work will aid other researchers as they seek the best multivariate information measure for their specific research goals and system.

As predicted by our theory, we found that for firing frequencies in the beta/gamma range, spike-time reliability is maximal when the time scale of the input fluctuations (autocorrelation time) is in the range of a few milliseconds (2-5 ms), coinciding with the time scale of fast synapses, and decreases substantially for faster and slower inputs. Finally, we comment how these findings relate to mechanisms causing neuronal synchronization.},

	abstract = {Background
          The widespread reluctance to share published research data is often hypothesized to be due to the authors' fear that reanalysis may expose errors in their work or may produce conclusions that contradict their own. However, these hypotheses have not previously been studied systematically.
        
        
          Methods and Findings
          We related the reluctance to share research data for reanalysis to 1148 statistically significant results reported in 49 papers published in two major psychology journals. We found the reluctance to share data to be associated with weaker evidence (against the null hypothesis of no effect) and a higher prevalence of apparent errors in the reporting of statistical results. The unwillingness to share data was particularly clear when reporting errors had a bearing on statistical significance.
        
        
          Conclusions
          Our findings on the basis of psychological papers suggest that statistical results are particularly hard to verify when reanalysis is more likely to lead to contrasting conclusions. This highlights the importance of establishing mandatory data archiving policies.},

Whereas some early computations are common across multiple sensory systems, they can utilize dissimilar underlying mechanisms depending on the properties of each modality. Recent work in the olfactory bulb has substantially clarified the neural algorithms underlying early odor processing. The high-dimensionality of odor space strictly limits the utility of topographical representations, forcing similarity-dependent computations such as decorrelation to employ unusual neural algorithms. The distinct architectures and properties of the two prominent computational layers in the olfactory bulb suggest that the bulb is directly comparable not only to the retina but also to primary visual cortex.},

	abstract = {Neural coding is a field of study that concerns how sensory information is represented in the brain by networks of neurons. The link between external stimulus and neural response can be studied from two parallel points of view. The first, neural encoding, refers to the mapping from stimulus to response. It focuses primarily on understanding how neurons respond to a wide variety of stimuli and constructing models that accurately describe the stimulus-response relationship. Neural decoding refers to the reverse mapping, from response to stimulus, where the challenge is to reconstruct a stimulus from the spikes it evokes. Since neuronal response is stochastic, a one-to-one mapping of stimuli into neural responses does not exist, causing a mismatch between the two viewpoints of neural coding. Here we use these two perspectives to investigate the question of what rate coding is, in the simple setting of a single stationary stimulus parameter and a single stationary spike train represented by a renewal process. We show that when rate codes are defined in terms of encoding, that is, the stimulus parameter is mapped onto the mean firing rate, the rate decoder given by spike counts or the sample mean does not always efficiently decode the rate codes, but it can improve efficiency in reading certain rate codes when correlations within a spike train are taken into account.},

Recent behavioral studies have examined the role of this computation in odor discrimination tasks and generated working models of behavioral odor discrimination strategies.

The future of scientific progress will be aided by bridging the gap between the millions of published research articles and modern databases such as the Allen brain atlas ({ABA).} To that end, we have analyzed the text of over 3.5 million scientific abstracts to find associations between neuroscientific concepts. From the literature alone, we show that we can blindly and algorithmically extract a "cognome": relationships between brain structure, function, and disease. We demonstrate the potential of data-mining and cross-platform data-integration with the {ABA} by introducing two methods for semi-automated hypothesis generation. By analyzing statistical "holes" and discrepancies in the literature we can find understudied or overlooked research paths. That is, we have added a layer of semi-automation to a part of the scientific process itself.

Strikingly, inhibitory responses are widespread among receptors. The temporal dynamics of the receptor repertoire provide a rich representation of odor quality, quantity, and duration. Receptors with similar odor sensitivity often map to widely dispersed glomeruli in the antennal lobe. We construct a multidimensional "odor space" based on the responses of each individual receptor and find that the positions of odors depend on their chemical class, concentration, and molecular complexity.

Such stimuli have the advantage of yielding easily interpreted answers, but have the disadvantage that they may fail to uncover complex or higher-order neuronal response properties. Here, we adopt an alternative approach, probing neuronal responses with complex acoustic stimuli, including animal vocalizations. We used in vivo whole-cell methods in the rat auditory cortex to record subthreshold membrane potential fluctuations elicited by these stimuli. Most neurons responded robustly and reliably to the complex stimuli in our ensemble. Using regularization techniques, we estimated the linear component, the spectrotemporal receptive field ({STRF)}, of the transformation from the sound (as represented by its time-varying spectrogram) to the membrane potential of the neuron. We find that the {STRF} has a rich dynamical structure, including excitatory regions positioned in general accord with the prediction of the classical tuning curve. However, whereas the {STRF} successfully predicts the responses to some of the natural stimuli, it surprisingly fails completely to predict the responses to others; on average, only 11\% of the response power could be predicted by the {STRF.} Therefore, most of the response of the neuron cannot be predicted by the linear component, although the response is deterministically related to the stimulus. Analysis of the systematic errors of the {STRF} model shows that this failure cannot be attributed to simple nonlinearities such as adaptation to mean intensity, rectification, or saturation. Rather, the highly nonlinear response properties of auditory cortical neurons must be attributable to nonlinear interactions between sound frequencies and time-varying properties of the neural encoder.},

It emphasizes that information processing in the brain depends not only on the electrophysiological properties of neurons but also on their dynamical properties. The book introduces dynamical systems, starting with one- and two-dimensional Hodgkin-Huxley-type models and continuing to a description of bursting systems. Each chapter proceeds from the simple to the complex, and provides sample problems at the end. The book explains all necessary mathematical concepts using geometrical intuition; it includes many figures and few equations, making it especially suitable for non-mathematicians. Each concept is presented in terms of both neuroscience and mathematics, providing a link between the two disciplines. Nonlinear dynamical systems theory is at the core of computational neuroscience research, but it is not a standard part of the graduate neuroscience curriculum--or taught by math or physics department in a way that is suitable for students of biology.

We examined neural interactions between visual area V4 and the lateral prefrontal cortex using simultaneous local field potential ({LFP)} recordings and single-unit activity ({SUA)} in monkeys performing a visual short-term memory task. During the memory period, we observed enhanced between-area phase synchronization in theta frequencies (3–9 Hz) of {LFPs} together with elevated phase locking of {SUA} to theta oscillations across regions. In addition, we found that the strength of intercortical locking was predictive of the animals' behavioral performance. This suggests that theta-band synchronization coordinates action potential communication between V4 and prefrontal cortex that may contribute to the maintenance of visual short-term memories.},

Using paired two-photon guided intracellular recordings, we show that Blanes cells have a presumptive axon and monosynaptically inhibit granule cells. Sensory axon stimulation evokes barrages of {EPSPs} in Blanes cells that trigger long epochs of persistent spiking; this firing mode was reset by hyperpolarizing membrane potential steps.

In addition, some preparations require thick slices, and direct visualization is not possible. Here we describe a protocol for the 'blind patch clamp method' that we developed several years ago to perform electrophysiological recordings in mammalian brain slices using a standard patch clamp amplifier, dissecting microscope and recording chamber.

We next evaluated whether vasoactive intestinal peptide ({VIP)} was responsible for the observed rhythm in {IPSC} frequency. Pretreatment of {SCN} slices with {VPAC1/VPAC2-} or {VPAC2-specific} receptor antagonists prevented the increase in {sIPSC} frequency in the {dSCN.} The rhythm in {sIPSC} frequency was absent in {VIP/peptide} histidine isoleucine ({PHI)-deficient} mice. Finally, we were able to detect a rhythm in the frequency of inhibitory synaptic transmission in mice held in constant darkness that was also dependent on {VIP} and the {VPAC2} receptor. Overall, these data demonstrate that there is a circadian rhythm in {GABAergic} transmission in the dorsal region of the mouse {SCN} and that the {VIP} is required for expression of this rhythm.},

	abstract = {Fitting models to behavior is commonly used to infer the latent computational factors responsible for generating behavior. However, the complexity of many behaviors can handicap the interpretation of such models. Here we provide perspectives on problems that can arise when interpreting parameter fits from models that provide incomplete descriptions of behavior. We illustrate these problems by fitting commonly used and neurophysiologically motivated reinforcement-learning models to simulated behavioral data sets from learning tasks. These model fits can pass a host of standard goodness-of-fit tests and other model-selection diagnostics even when the models do not provide a complete description of the behavioral data. We show that such incomplete models can be misleading by yielding biased estimates of the parameters explicitly included in the models. This problem is particularly pernicious when the neglected factors are unknown and therefore not easily identified by model comparisons and similar methods. An obvious conclusion is that a parsimonious description of behavioral data does not necessarily imply an accurate description of the underlying computations. Moreover, general goodness-of-fit measures are not a strong basis to support claims that a particular model can provide a generalized understanding of the computations that govern behavior. To help overcome these challenges, we advocate the design of tasks that provide direct reports of the computational variables of interest. Such direct reports complement model-fitting approaches by providing a more complete, albeit possibly more task-specific, representation of the factors that drive behavior. Computational models then provide a means to connect such task-specific results to a more general algorithmic understanding of the brain.},

We resort to {McGhee's} biological shape space concept in order to formalize our analysis, allowing for comparison between the geometrically possible tree-like shapes, obtained by using a simple reference model, and real neuronal shapes. Two optimal types of projections, namely, principal component analysis and canonical analysis, are used in order to visualize the originally 20-D neuron distribution into 2-D morphological spaces. These projections allow the most important features to be identified. A data density analysis is also performed in the original 20-D feature space in order to corroborate the clustering structure. Several interesting results are reported, including the fact that real neurons occupy only a small region within the geometrically possible space and that two principal variables are enough to account for about half of the overall data variability. Most of the measurements have been found to be important in representing the morphological variability of the real neurons.},

We measured the local field potential ({LFP)} and V1 spiking activity while monkeys performed an attention-demanding detection task. We show that gamma oscillations were strongly modulated by the stimulus and by attention. Stimuli that engaged inhibitory mechanisms induced the largest gamma {LFP} oscillations and the largest spike field coherence. Directing attention toward a visual stimulus at the receptive field of the recorded neurons decreased {LFP} gamma power and gamma spike field coherence. This decrease could reflect an attention-mediated reduction of surround inhibition. Changes in synchrony in V1 would thus be a byproduct of reduced inhibitory drive, rather than a mechanism that directly aids perceptual processing.},

	abstract = {Cortical rhythms in the alpha/mu frequency range (7-12 Hz) have been variously related to "idling," anticipation, seizure, and short-term or working memory. This overabundance of interpretations suggests that sensory cortex may be able to produce more than one (and even more than two) distinct alpha/mu rhythms. Here we describe simultaneous local field potential and single-neuron recordings made from primary sensory (gustatory) cortex of awake rats and reveal three distinct 7-12 Hz de novo network rhythms within single sessions: an "early," taste-induced approximately 11 Hz rhythm, the first peak of which was a short-latency gustatory evoked potential; a "late," significantly lower-frequency (approximately 7 Hz) rhythm that replaced this first rhythm at approximately 750-850 ms after stimulus onset (consistently timed with a previously described shift in taste temporal codes); and a "spontaneous" spike-and-wave rhythm of intermediate peak frequency (approximately 9 Hz) that appeared late in the session, as part of a oft-described reduction in arousal/attention. These rhythms proved dissociable on many grounds: in addition to having different peak frequencies, amplitudes, and shapes and appearing at different time points (although often within single 3 s snippets of activity), the early and late rhythms proved to have completely uncorrelated session-to-session variability, and the spontaneous rhythm affected the early rhythm only (having no impact on the late rhythm). Analysis of spike-to-wave coupling suggested that the early and late rhythms are a unified part of discriminative taste process: the identity of phase-coupled single-neuron ensembles differed from taste to taste, and coupling typically lasted across the change in frequency. These data reveal that even rhythms confined to a narrow frequency band may still have distinct properties.},

Here we show, using whole-exome sequencing of 928 individuals, including 200 phenotypically discordant sibling pairs, that highly disruptive (nonsense and splice-site) de novo mutations in brain-expressed genes are associated with autism spectrum disorders and carry large effects. On the basis of mutation rates in unaffected individuals, we demonstrate that multiple independent de novo single nucleotide variants in the same gene among unrelated probands reliably identifies risk alleles, providing a clear path forward for gene discovery. Among a total of 279 identified de novo coding mutations, there is a single instance in probands, and none in siblings, in which two independent nonsense variants disrupt the same gene, {SCN2A} (sodium channel, voltage-gated, type {II}, α subunit), a result that is highly unlikely by chance.},

Under these conditions, information maximization has extra properties not found in the linear case (Linsker 1989). The nonlinearities in the transfer function are able to pick up higher-order moments of the input distributions and perform something akin to true redundancy reduction between units in the output representation. This enables the network to separate statistically independent components in the inputs: a higher-order generalization of principal components analysis. We apply the network to the source separation (or cocktail party) problem, successfully separating unknown mixtures of up to 10 speakers. We also show that a variant on the network architecture is able to perform blind deconvolution (cancellation of unknown echoes and reverberation in a speech signal). Finally, we derive dependencies of information transfer on time delays. We suggest that information maximization provides a unifying framework for problems in "blind" signal processing.},

	abstract = {Members of the {HCN} channel family generate hyperpolarization-activated cation currents (Ih) that are directly regulated by {cAMP} and contribute to pacemaker activity in heart and brain. The four {HCN} isoforms show distinct but overlapping patterns of expression in different tissues. Here, we report that {HCN1} and {HCN2}, isoforms coexpressed in neocortex and hippocampus that differ markedly in their biophysical properties, coassemble to generate heteromultimeric channels with novel properties. When expressed in Xenopus oocytes, {HCN1} channels activate 5-10-fold more rapidly than {HCN2} channels. {HCN1} channels also activate at voltages that are 10-20 {mV} more positive than those required to activate {HCN2.} In cell-free patches, the steady-state activation curve of {HCN1} channels shows a minimal shift in response to {cAMP} (+4 {mV)}, whereas that of {HCN2} channels shows a pronounced shift (+17 {mV).} Coexpression of {HCN1} and {HCN2} yields Ih currents that activate with kinetics and a voltage dependence that tend to be intermediate between those of {HCN1} and {HCN2} homomers, although the coexpressed channels do show a relatively large shift by {cAMP} (+14 {mV).} Neither the kinetics, steady-state voltage dependence, nor {cAMP} dose-response curve for the coexpressed Ih can be reproduced by the linear sum of independent populations of {HCN1} and {HCN2} homomers. These results are most simply explained by the formation of heteromeric channels with novel properties. The properties of these heteromeric channels closely resemble the properties of I(h) in hippocampal {CA1} pyramidal neurons, cells that coexpress {HCN1} and {HCN2.} Finally, differences in Ih channel properties recorded in cell-free patches versus intact oocytes are shown to be due, in part, to modulation of Ih by basal levels of {cAMP} in intact cells.},

Using whole-cell recording in freely moving rats exploring a novel maze, we observed differences in intrinsic cellular properties and input-based subthreshold membrane potential levels underlying this division into place and silent cells. Compared to silent cells, place cells had lower spike thresholds and peaked versus flat subthreshold membrane potentials as a function of animal location. Both differences were evident from the beginning of exploration. Additionally, future place cells exhibited higher burst propensity before exploration. Thus, internal settings appear to predetermine which cells will represent the next novel environment encountered. Furthermore, place cells fired spatially tuned bursts with large, putatively calcium-mediated depolarizations that could trigger plasticity and stabilize the new map for long-term storage.

This question has been examined using microelectrode recordings and subsequent neurobiotin filling and reconstruction of neurons in the deep cerebellar nuclei ({DCN)} of brain slices from young rats (P13-16). The neurons reconstructed from these recordings were mostly large and multipolar (17/21 cells) and were likely to represent glutamatergic projection neurons. Within this class, there was considerable variation in intrinsic electrical properties and cellular morphology. Remarkably, in a correlation matrix of 18 electrophysiological and 6 morphological measures, only one morphological characteristic was predictive of intrinsic excitability: neurons with more spines had a significantly slower basal firing rate. To address the possibility that neurons with fewer spines represented a slowly maturing subgroup, recordings and reconstructions were also made from neurons at a younger age (P6-9). While P6-9 neurons were morphologically indistinguishable from P13 to 16 neurons, they were considerably less excitable: P6-9 neurons had a lower spontaneous spiking rate, larger fast {AHPs}, higher resting membrane potentials, and smaller rebound depolarizations. Thus while the large projection neurons of the {DCN} are morphologically mature by P6-9, they continue to mature electrophysiologically through P13-16 in a way that renders them more responsive to the burst-and-pause pattern that characterizes Purkinje cell inhibitory synaptic drive.},

Second, the distribution of nonzero synaptic strengths between nearby cortical neurons can also be described by a lognormal distribution. Here we use a simple model of cortical activity to reconcile these observations. The model makes the experimentally testable prediction that synaptic efficacies onto a given cortical neuron are statistically correlated, i.e., it predicts that some neurons receive stronger synapses than other neurons. We propose a simple Hebb-like learning rule that gives rise to such correlations and yields both lognormal firing rates and synaptic efficacies.

It remains unclear how individual cortical neurons encode olfactory information in unanesthetized animals. By single-cell recordings from head-restrained awake mice, we studied the odor response profiles of individual neurons in the anterior piriform cortex ({aPCX).} Neurons were juxtacellularly labeled, and their cell types were determined by their morphology and neurotransmitter phenotypes. We found a considerable level of variability in selectivity patterns among pyramidal neurons ({PNs).} Approximately one-quarter of {PNs} were broadly activated by structurally dissimilar odorants, whereas the excitations to the rest of {PNs} were highly selective. Broad inhibition was only observed from a subpopulation of {PNs.} {GABAergic} neurons displayed nonselective excitatory responses to test odorants and rarely exhibited inhibition. In contrast, non-{GABAergic} nonpyramidal neurons in the deep layer tended to be strongly inhibited by multiple different odorants. Our findings suggest that odor representation is accomplished by both broadly tuned and narrow-tuned {PNs} in the {aPCX} of awake animals. In addition, various types of interneurons may play different roles in the intracortical processing of olfactory information.},

This rich repertoire of channels allows neurons to encode information by generating action potentials with a wide range of shapes, frequencies and patterns. Recent work offers an increasingly detailed understanding of how the expression of particular channel types underlies the remarkably diverse firing behaviour of various types of neurons.},

	abstract = {We compute the exact spike-triggered average ({STA)} of the voltage for the nonleaky integrate-and-fire ({IF)} cell in continuous time, driven by gaussian white noise. The computation is based on techniques from the theory of renewal processes and continuous-time hidden Markov processes (e.g., the backward and forward Fokker-Planck partial differential equations associated with first-passage time densities). From the {STA} voltage, it is straightforward to derive the {STA} input current. The theory also gives an explicit asymptotic approximation for the {STA} of the leaky {IF} cell, valid in the low-noise regime sigma --{\textgreater} 0. We consider both the {STA} and the conditional average voltage given an observed spike "doublet" event, that is, two spikes separated by some fixed period of silence. In each case, we find that the {STA} as a function of time-preceding-spike, tau, has a square root singularity as tau approaches zero from below and scales linearly with the scale of injected noise current. We close by briefly examining the discrete-time case, where similar phenomena are observed.},

	abstract = {The ability to generate subthreshold membrane potential oscillations in neurons from the inferior olive nucleus has been attributed to the electrical properties of these neurons, as well as to the properties of the network. In the present in vitro study we quantitatively characterized both intrinsic membrane and network properties that are directly involved in the oscillatory activity of olivary neurons in the guinea-pig. We also implemented an alternating current analysis to explore the resonance behavior of these neurons and to compare the resonant properties with the properties of the oscillatory activity. Spectral analysis, used for the quantitative characterization of the oscillatory activity under various experimental conditions, revealed that the pattern of the oscillatory activity is network specific rather than cell specific. These results are in agreement with the hypothesis that the oscillatory activity of olivary neurons is generated by a network of electrically coupled neurons. Using alternating current analysis, we found that impedance-frequency curves of olivary neurons demonstrate a peak impedance (resonance) at a frequency between 3 and 10 Hz, which corresponds to the frequency of the spontaneous oscillations. Like the spontaneous oscillations, this peak is tetrodotoxin insensitive, unaffected by K+ channel blockers and almost completely blocked in the presence of Ni2+ in the physiological solution. Increasing the temperature increases the resonance frequency, as well as the frequency of the spontaneous oscillations. These results show that the resonant behavior of individual neurons is the basis of the oscillatory behavior of the network and that resonance can serve as a lumped parameter which encodes the oscillatory tendency of a neuron.},

The preference for a multistep mechanism reflects the fact that signals arising from direct {OSN} inputs are drastically shunted by connexin 36-mediated gap junctions on {MCs}, but not tufted cells.

Laminar analysis of neocortical gamma bursts revealed multiple gamma oscillators of varying frequency and location, which were spatially confined and synchronized local groups of neurons. A significant fraction of putative pyramidal cells and interneurons as well as localized gamma oscillations in all recorded neocortical areas were phase biased by the hippocampal theta rhythm.

Odorants are initially detected by odorant receptors ({ORs)} on olfactory sensory neurons ({OSNs)} in the nose. In the mouse, each {OSN} expresses one of ∼1000 different {OR} genes. Although {OSNs} and their expressed {ORs} constitute the fundamental units of sensory input to the brain, a comprehensive understanding of how they encode odor identities is still lacking. To gain a broader and more detailed understanding of odorant recognition and odor coding at this level, we tested the responses of 3000 mouse {OSNs} to 125 odorants with diverse structures and perceived odors. These studies revealed extraordinary diversity, but also bias, in odorant recognition by the {OSN}, and thus {OR}, repertoire. They indicate that most {OSNs} are narrowly tuned to detect a subset of odorants with related structures and often related odors, but that the repertoire also includes broadly tuned components. Strikingly, the vast majority of odorants activated a unique set of {OSNs}, usually two or more in combination. The resulting combinatorial codes varied in size among odorants and sometimes contained both narrowly and broadly tuned components. While many {OSNs} recognized multiple odorants, some appeared specific for a given pheromone or other animal-associated compound, or for one or more odorants with a particular odor quality, raising the possibility that signals derived from some {OSNs} and {ORs} might elicit an innate behavior or convey a specific odor quality.},

We pursue an analysis of neural response variance to unveil neural computations that cannot be discerned from measures of average firing rate. We analyzed single-neuron recordings from the lateral intraparietal area ({LIP)}, during a perceptual decision-making task. Spike count variance was divided into two components using the law of total variance for doubly stochastic processes: (1) variance of counts that would be produced by a stochastic point process with a given rate, and loosely (2) the variance of the rates that would produce those counts (i.e., "conditional expectation"). The variance and correlation of the conditional expectation exposed several neural mechanisms: mixtures of firing rate states preceding the decision, accumulation of stochastic "evidence" during decision formation, and a stereotyped response at decision end. These analyses help to differentiate among several alternative decision-making models. {VIDEO} {ABSTRACT:}},

	abstract = {Olfactory information is processed by a diverse group of interconnected forebrain regions. Most efforts to define the cellular mechanisms involved in processing olfactory information have been focused on understanding the function of the olfactory bulb, the primary second-order olfactory region, and its principal target, the piriform cortex. However, the olfactory bulb also projects to other targets, including the rarely studied olfactory tubercle, a ventral brain region recently implicated in regulating cocaine-related reward behavior. We used whole cell patch-clamp recordings from rat tubercle slices to define the intrinsic properties of neurons in the dense and multiform cell layers. We find three common firing modes of tubercle neurons: regular-spiking, intermittent-discharging, and bursting. Regular-spiking neurons are typically spiny-dense-cell-layer cells with pyramidal-shaped, dendritic arborizations. Intermittently discharging and bursting neurons comprise the majority of the deeper multiform layer and share a common morphology: multipolar, sparsely spiny cells. Rather than generating all-or-none stereotyped discharges, as observed in many brain areas, bursting cells in the tubercle generate depolarizing plateau potentials that trigger graded but time-limited discharges. We find two distinct subclasses of bursting cells that respond similarly to step stimuli but differ in the role transmembrane Ca currents play in their intrinsic behavior. Calcium currents amplify depolarizing inputs and enhance excitability in regenerative bursting cells, whereas the primary action of Ca in nonregenerative bursting tubercle neurons appears to be to decrease excitability by triggering Ca-activated K currents. Nonregenerative bursting cells exhibit a prolonged refractory period after even short discharges suggesting that they may function to detect transient events.},

	abstract = {Although neuronal excitability is well understood and accurately modeled over timescales of up to hundreds of milliseconds, it is currently unclear whether extrapolating from this limited duration to longer behaviorally relevant timescales is appropriate. Here we used an extracellular recording and stimulation paradigm that extends the duration of single-neuron electrophysiological experiments, exposing the dynamics of excitability in individual cultured cortical neurons over timescales hitherto inaccessible. We show that the long-term neuronal excitability dynamics is unstable and dominated by critical fluctuations, intermittency, scale-invariant rate statistics, and long memory. These intrinsic dynamics bound the firing rate over extended timescales, contrasting observed short-term neuronal response to stimulation onset. Furthermore, the activity of a neuron over extended timescales shows transitions between quasi-stable modes, each characterized by a typical response pattern. Like in the case of rate statistics, the short-term onset response pattern that often serves to functionally define a given neuron is not indicative of its long-term ongoing response. These observations question the validity of describing neuronal excitability based on temporally restricted electrophysiological data, calling for in-depth exploration of activity over wider temporal scales. Such extended experiments will probably entail a different kind of neuronal models, accounting for the unbounded range, from milliseconds up.},

The formalism was validated on simulated data and applied to real neurons recorded from the rat somatosensory cortex. From the general Poisson exact breakdown, a considerable number of mutual information measures introduced in the neural computation literature can be directly derived, including the exact breakdown (Pola, Thiele, Hoffmann, \& Panzeri, 2003), the Poisson exact breakdown (Scaglione, Foffani, Scannella, Cerutti, \& Moxon, 2008) the synergy and redundancy between neurons (Schneidman, Bialek, \& Berry, 2003), and the information lost by an optimal decoder that assumes the absence of correlations between neurons (Nirenberg \& Latham, 2003; Pola et al., 2003). The general Poisson exact breakdown thus offers a convenient set of building blocks for studying the role of correlations in population codes.},

There are essentially two views of how selectivity arises. Feed-forward models rely entirely on the organization of thalamocortical inputs. Feedback models rely on lateral inhibition to refine selectivity relative to a weak bias provided by thalamocortical inputs. The debate is driven by two divergent lines of evidence. On the one hand, many response properties appear to require lateral inhibition, including precise orientation and direction selectivity and crossorientation suppression. On the other hand, intracellular recordings have failed to find consistent evidence for lateral inhibition. Here we demonstrate a resolution to this paradox. Feed-forward models incorporating the intrinsic nonlinear properties of cortical neurons and feed-forward circuits (i.e., spike threshold, contrast saturation, and spike-rate rectification) can account for properties that have previously appeared to require lateral inhibition.},

        Neurons perform complicated non-linear transformations on their input before producing their output - a train of action potentials. This input-output transformation is shaped by the specific composition of ion channels, out of the many possible types, that are embedded in the neuron's membrane. Experimentally, characterizing this transformation relies on injecting different stimuli to the neuron while recording its output; but which of the many possible stimuli should one apply? This combined experimental and theoretical study provides a general theoretical framework for answering this question, examining how different stimuli constrain the space of faithful conductance-based models of the studied neuron. We show that combinations of intracellular step and ramp currents enable the construction of models that both replicate the cell's response and generalize very well to novel stimuli e.g., to “noisy” stimuli mimicking synaptic activity. We experimentally verified our theoretical predictions on several cortical neuron types. This work presents a novel method for reliably linking the microscopic membrane ion channels to the macroscopic electrical behavior of neurons. It provides a much-needed rationale for selecting a particular stimulus set for studying the input-output properties of neurons and paves the way for standardization of experimental protocols along with construction of reliable neuron models.},

Two-photon Ca2+ imaging–derived optical quantal analysis and correlated electron microscopic reconstructions revealed a tight correlation between the release probability and the active-zone area. Peak amplitude of [Ca2+] transients in single boutons also positively correlated with the active-zone area. Freeze-fracture immunogold labeling revealed that the voltage-gated calcium channel subunit Cav2.1 and the presynaptic protein Rim1/2 are confined to the active zone and their numbers scale linearly with the active-zone area. Gold particles labeling Cav2.1 were nonrandomly distributed in the active zones. Our results demonstrate that the numbers of several active-zone proteins, including presynaptic calcium channels, as well as the number of docked vesicles and the release probability, scale linearly with the active-zone area.},

	abstract = {Neuromodulatory control by oxytocin is essential to a wide range of social, parental and stress-related behaviours. Autism spectrum disorders ({ASD)} are associated with deficiencies in oxytocin levels and with genetic alterations of the oxytocin receptor ({OXTR).} Thirty years ago, Mühlethaler et al. found that oxytocin increases the firing of inhibitory hippocampal neurons, but it remains unclear how elevated inhibition could account for the ability of oxytocin to improve information processing in the brain. Here we describe in mammalian hippocampus a simple yet powerful mechanism by which oxytocin enhances cortical information transfer while simultaneously lowering background activity, thus greatly improving the signal-to-noise ratio. Increased fast-spiking interneuron activity not only suppresses spontaneous pyramidal cell firing, but also enhances the fidelity of spike transmission and sharpens spike timing. Use-dependent depression at the fast-spiking interneuron–pyramidal cell synapse is both necessary and sufficient for the enhanced spike throughput. We show the generality of this novel circuit mechanism by activation of fast-spiking interneurons with cholecystokinin or channelrhodopsin-2. This provides insight into how a diffusely delivered neuromodulator can improve the performance of neural circuitry that requires synapse specificity and millisecond precision.},

Frequently only a few spike trains are available in each class. We derive analytical expressions for the small-sample bias present when comparing estimators of the time-dependent firing intensity. We then exploit analogies between the comparison of firing intensities and previously used spike train metrics and show that improved spike train measures can be successfully used for fitting neuron models to experimental data, for comparisons of spike trains, and classification of spike train data. In classification tasks, the improved similarity measures can increase the recovered information. We demonstrate that when similarity measures are used for fitting mathematical models, all previous methods systematically underestimate the noise. Finally, we show a striking implication of this deterministic bias by reevaluating the results of the single-neuron prediction challenge.},

However, the mean and variance of the intrinsic and synaptic properties of {PCs} changed dramatically between P10 and P29. The input resistance, membrane time constant, and resting membrane potential decreased, leading to reduced neural excitability in older animals. Likewise, there were age-dependent decreases in the amplitude and decay time of the excitatory postsynaptic potentials as well as short-term synaptic depression. Both the intrinsic and synaptic properties underwent a transitional period between P10 and P18 prior to reaching steady state at P19-P29. We show that these properties combine to produce age-related differential synaptic responses to low- and high-frequency synaptic input that may contribute to differences in auditory processing during development.},

Theoretical and experimental studies have described several mechanisms by which oscillations can be generated and synchronized. Here, we investigate the hypothesis that correlated noisy inputs are able to generate synchronous oscillations in olfactory bulb mitral cells in vitro. We consider several alternative mechanisms and conclude that olfactory bulb synchronous oscillations are likely to arise because of the response of uncoupled oscillating neurons to aperiodic but correlated inputs. This mechanism has been described theoretically, but we provide the first experimental evidence that such a mechanism may underlie synchronization in real neurons. In physiological experiments, we show that this mechanism can generate gamma-band oscillations in populations of olfactory bulb mitral cells. This mechanism synchronizes oscillatory firing by using shared fast fluctuations in stochastic inputs across neurons, without requiring any synaptic or electrical coupling. We discuss the properties and limitations of synchronization by this mechanism and suggest that it may underlie fast oscillations in many brain areas.},

Inside one voxel of a cubic millimeter of neocortex, fifty to hundred thousand neurons use 4 km of axonal cable to form three to fifteen hundred million synapses with each other. While in the human, such voxel is a small fragment of a cortical area, in the mouse an entire cortical area, like the primary auditory cortex, can be contained in a voxel of this size. This raises the fundamental question of what happens inside such a voxel? Are the circuits contained in this voxel, and their operations, different in every area, or are there general principles that are conserved across cortical areas and species? Such questions go to the heart of understanding how the neocortex wires itself and works. One proposal is to answer these questions by mapping the entire circuit at synaptic resolution to produce a ‘connectome’ — of the cortical column, or even of the entire brain. However, such a high-resolution connectome is self-evidently unachievable with the tools available and as a strategy it still leaves us short of understanding the ‘principles of neural engineering’. We offer an alternative route that uses physiology and computational modeling as a means of generating ‘predictive anatomy’, where the questions about underlying structure are directed to fundamental principles of organization and operation of the cortical circuits. This approach involves ‘sparse’ rather than ‘dense’ reconstructions at light and electron microscope resolution to keep the questions well-matched to current experimental tools. Rather than providing a snap-shot of an entire wiring diagram, our strategy provides for a statistical description of the circuit and integrates theory, function, and structure in a common framework.},

	abstract = {1. Whole-cell and sharp electrode recordings from adult rat dentate gyrus {GCs} were performed in the 400-microns-thick hippocampal slice preparation maintained at 34 +/- 1 degrees C. Intrinsic membrane properties of granule cells ({GCs)} were evaluated with the use of a switching current-clamp amplifier. 2. With the whole-cell technique, the average resting membrane potential ({RMP)} of {GCs} was -85 {mV} when a potassium gluconate electrode solution was used versus -74 {mV} measured with potassium acetate-filled sharp microelectrodes. The membrane voltage response to injected current was linear over two membrane potential ranges, greater than 10 {mV} hyperpolarized from {RMP} and between 10 {mV} more negative than {RMP} and -62 {mV.} The average input resistances ({RN)} calculated over these ranges were 107 and 228 M omega in the whole-cell recordings versus 37 and 54 M omega in the sharp electrode recordings. There was no correlation between {RMP} and {RN} with either recording technique. The membrane time constant (tau m) determined at the {RMP} was 26.9 ms for whole-cell recordings and 13.9 ms for sharp electrode recordings. 3. There was no evidence of time-dependent changes in {RMP}, {RN}, and tau m in whole-cell recordings, although the slow inward rectification seen at hyperpolarized potentials decreased over 30-60 min. Addition of calcium buffers to the whole-cell recording solution did not result in a significant change in the average {RMP}, the average {RN}, or the average tau m. 4. Action potential threshold was comparable in whole-cell (-49 {mV)} and sharp electrode (-52 {mV)} recordings, but action potential amplitude was larger in whole-cell (126 {mV)} than in sharp electrode (106 {mV)} recordings. Spike frequency adaptation was present in the whole-cell recordings and could be abolished by addition of calcium buffers to the electrode solution. 5. We estimated rho, the ratio of dendritic to somatic conductance, to be 5.1 for the whole-cell records and 2.1 for sharp electrode recordings. The electrotonic length of the equivalent cylinder representing the cell processes was estimated to be 0.49 from the whole-cell data and 0.79 from the sharp electrode recordings. This implies that at rest there is only a 10\% decrement in steady-state membrane voltage along the length of the dendrite due to shunting across the membrane resistance; small synaptic events occurring in the distal dendritic tree will therefore have a more substantial influence on the soma than previous analyses suggested.({ABSTRACT} {TRUNCATED} {AT} 400 {WORDS)}},

Neuronal networks that are directly associated with glomeruli in the olfactory bulb are thought to comprise functional modules. However, this has not yet been experimentally proven. In this study, we explored the anatomical and functional architecture of glomerular modules using in vivo two-photon calcium imaging. Surprisingly, the deep portions of the glomerular modules showed considerable spatial overlap with other modules. Juxtaglomerular cells showed similar excitatory odorant response profiles to presynaptic olfactory sensory neuron inputs. Mitral cells exhibited a more sharply tuned molecular receptive range compared to juxtaglomerular cells, and their odorant response profiles varied depending on their interneuronal horizontal distances. These data suggest that glomerular modules are composed of functionally distinct neurons, and that homogenous odor inputs to each glomerulus may be parsed and processed in different fashions within the modules before being sent to higher olfactory centers.},

Unlike clustering methods for local dimensionality reduction, {LLE} maps its inputs into a single global coordinate system of lower dimensionality, and its optimizations do not involve local minima. By exploiting the local symmetries of linear reconstructions, {LLE} is able to learn the global structure of nonlinear manifolds, such as those generated by images of faces or documents of text.},

Driven by a thalamic gamma oscillator and initially independent of cortical inhibition, {EGOs} synchronize neurons in a single thalamic barreloid and corresponding cortical barrel and support plasticity at developing thalamocortical synapses. We propose that the multiple replay of sensory input in thalamocortical circuits during {EGOs} allows thalamic and cortical neurons to be organized into vertical topographic functional units before the development of horizontal binding in adult brain.},

	abstract = {Tracking odour trails is a crucial behaviour for many animals, often leading to food, mates or away from danger. It is an excellent example of active sampling, where the animal itself controls how to sense the environment. Here we show that rats can track odour trails accurately with near-optimal sampling. We trained rats to follow odour trails drawn on paper spooled through a treadmill. By recording local field potentials ({LFPs)} from the olfactory bulb, and sniffing rates, we find that sniffing but not {LFPs} differ between tracking and non-tracking conditions. Rats can track odours within {\textasciitilde}1 cm, and this accuracy is degraded when one nostril is closed. Moreover, they show path prediction on encountering a fork, wide 'casting' sweeps on encountering a gap and detection of reappearance of the trail in 1–2 sniffs. We suggest that rats use a multi-layered strategy, and achieve efficient sampling and high accuracy in this complex task.

	abstract = {Author {SummaryOne} hundred years ago, Alexander Graham Bell asked: {“Can} you measure the difference between one kind of smell and another? It is very obvious that we have very many different kinds of smells, all the way from the odor of violets and roses up to asafetida. But until you can measure their likenesses and differences you can have no science of odor.” Here we developed a computational framework and algorithm that looks at the molecular structure of two odors and predicts their ensuing perceptual similarity. Importantly, the algorithm works for odors that are each composed of a mixture containing tens of different molecules, much like natural smells. The algorithm that worked best was one that treats the odor-mixture as a single value, rather than a bunch of values reflecting each of its components. This is consistent with the growing view of how the mammalian brain treats odors: synthesizing a singular odor percept rather than analytically extracting individual odorant features from the odor-mixture. In conclusion, our algorithm's performance may contribute to the practice of the science of odor, and our algorithm's nature may contribute to the understanding of brain mechanisms of smell.},

We have in mind a model in which neurons are selective for a small number of stimulus dimensions out of a high-dimensional stimulus space, but within this subspace the responses can be arbitrarily nonlinear. Existing analysis methods are based on correlation functions between stimuli and responses, but these methods are guaranteed to work only in the case of gaussian stimulus ensembles. As an alternative to correlation functions, we maximize the mutual information between the neural responses and projections of the stimulus onto low-dimensional subspaces. The procedure can be done iteratively by increasing the dimensionality of this subspace. Those dimensions that allow the recovery of all of the information between spikes and the full unprojected stimuli describe the relevant subspace. If the dimensionality of the relevant subspace indeed is small, it becomes feasible to map the neuron's input-output function even under fully natural stimulus conditions. These ideas are illustrated in simulations on model visual and auditory neurons responding to natural scenes and sounds, respectively.},

In neocortical pyramidal neurons, adaptation manifests itself by an increase in the firing threshold and by adaptation currents triggered after each spike. Combining electrophysiological recordings in mice with modeling, we found that these adaptation processes lasted for more than 20 s and decayed over multiple timescales according to a power law. The power-law decay associated with adaptation mirrored and canceled the temporal correlations of input current received in vivo at the somata of layer 2/3 somatosensory pyramidal neurons. These findings suggest that, in the cortex, {SFA} causes temporal decorrelation of output spikes (temporal whitening), an energy-efficient coding procedure that, at high signal-to-noise ratio, improves the information transfer.},

To address this problem a new Topological Relations schema for the Relations module of {BAMS} (Brain Architecture Knowledge Management System) was created. It includes a representation of the qualitative spatial relations between nervous system parts defined in different neuroanatomical nomenclatures or atlases and is general enough to record data and metadata from the literature, regardless of description level or species. Based on this foundation a Projections Translations inference engine was developed for the {BAMS} interface that automatically translates neuroanatomical projection (axonal inputs and outputs) reports across nomenclatures from translated information. To make {BAMS} more useful to the neuroscience community three things were done. First, we implemented a simple schema for validation of the translated neuroanatomical projections. Second, more than 1,000 topological relations between brain gray matter regions for the rat were inserted, along with associated details. Finally, a case study was performed to enter all historical or legacy published information about terminology related to one relatively complex gray matter region of the rat. The bed nuclei of the stria terminalis ({BST)} were chosen and 21 different nomenclatures from 1923 to present were collated, along with 284 terms for parts (gray matter differentiations), 360 qualitative topological relations between parts, and more than 7,000 details about spatial relations between parts, all of which was annotated with appropriate metadata. This information was used to construct a graphical "knowledge map" of relations used in the literature to describe subdivisions of the rat {BST.}},

Using {3D} reconstructions of 298 neocortical cells of different types (including nest basket, small basket, large basket, bitufted, pyramidal, and Martinotti cells), we constructed a structural model of a cortical microcircuit, in which cells of different types were independently and randomly placed. We compared the positions of physical appositions resulting from the incidental overlap of axonal and dendritic arbors in the model (statistical structural connectivity) with the positions of putative functional synapses (functional synaptic connectivity) in 90 synaptic connections reconstructed from cortical slice preparations. Overall, we found that statistical connectivity predicted an average of 74 ± 2.7\% (mean ± {SEM)} synapse location distributions for nine types of cortical connections. This finding suggests that chemospecific attractive and repulsive mechanisms generally do not result in pairwise-specific connectivity. In some cases, however, the predicted distributions do not match precisely, indicating that chemospecific steering and aligning of the arbors may occur for some types of connections. This finding suggests that random alignment of axonal and dendritic arbors provides a sufficient foundation for specific functional connectivity to emerge in local neural microcircuits.},

Gamma-frequency oscillatory activity of inhibitory subnetworks has been hypothesized to regulate information processing in the cortex as a whole. Inhibitory neurons in these subnetworks synchronize their firing and selectively innervate the perisomatic compartments of their target neurons, generating both tonic and rapidly fluctuating inhibition. How do different types of cortical neurons respond to changes in the level and structure of perisomatic inhibition? What accounts for response heterogeneity between cell types, and are these response properties fixed or flexible? To answer these questions, we use in vitro whole-cell recording and dynamic-clamp somatic current injection to study six distinct types of cortical neurons. We demonstrate that different types of neurons systematically vary in their receptiveness to fast changes in the structure of inhibition and the range over which changes in inhibitory tone affect their output. Using simple neuron models and model neuron hybrids (dynamic clamp), we determine which intrinsic differences between cell types lead to these variations in receptiveness. These results suggest important differences in the way cell types are affected by gamma-frequency inhibition, which may have important circuit level implications. Although intrinsic differences observed in vitro are useful for the elucidation of basic cellular properties and differences between cell types, we also investigate how the integrative properties of neurons are likely to be rapidly modulated in the context of active networks in vivo.},

	abstract = {The early processing of sensory information by neuronal circuits often includes a reshaping of activity patterns that may facilitate further processing in the brain. For instance, in the olfactory system the activity patterns that related odors evoke at the input of the olfactory bulb can be highly similar. Nevertheless, the corresponding activity patterns of the mitral cells, which represent the output of the olfactory bulb, can differ significantly from each other due to strong inhibition by granule cells and peri-glomerular cells. Motivated by these results we study simple adaptive inhibitory networks that aim to separate or even orthogonalize activity patterns representing similar stimuli. Since the animal experiences the different stimuli at different times it is difficult for the network to learn the connectivity based on their similarity; biologically it is more plausible that learning is driven by simultaneous correlations between the input channels. We investigate the connection between pattern orthogonalization and channel decorrelation and demonstrate that networks can achieve effective pattern orthogonalization through channel decorrelation if they simultaneously equalize their output levels. In feedforward networks biophysically plausible learning mechanisms fail, however, for even moderately similar input patterns. Recurrent networks do not have that limitation; they can orthogonalize the representations of highly similar input patterns. Even when they are optimized for linear neuronal dynamics they perform very well when the dynamics are nonlinear. These results provide insights into fundamental features of simplified inhibitory networks that may be relevant for pattern orthogonalization by neuronal circuits in general.},

We calculate much larger storage capacities for cells with nonlinear subunits and show that this capacity is accessible to a structural learning rule that combines random synapse formation with activity-dependent stabilization/elimination. In a departure from the common view that memories are encoded in the overall connection strengths between neurons, our results suggest that long-term information storage in neural tissue could reside primarily in the selective addressing of synaptic contacts onto dendritic subunits.},

Understanding this variability is critical for theories of both sensory and motor processing, since response variance affects the accuracy of neural codes. Despite this influence, the cellular and circuit mechanisms that shape the trial-to-trial variability of population responses remain poorly understood. We used a combination of experimental and computational techniques to uncover the mechanisms underlying response variability of populations of pyramidal (E) cells in layer 2/3 of rat whisker barrel cortex. Spike trains recorded from pairs of E-cells during either spontaneous activity or whisker deflected responses show similarly low levels of spiking co-variability, despite large differences in network activation between the two states. We developed network models that show how spike threshold non-linearities dilute E-cell spiking co-variability during spontaneous activity and low velocity whisker deflections. In contrast, during high velocity whisker deflections, cancelation mechanisms mediated by feedforward inhibition maintain low E-cell pairwise co-variability. Thus, the combination of these two mechanisms ensure low E-cell population variability over a wide range of whisker deflection velocities. Finally, we show how this active decorrelation of population variability leads to a drastic increase in the population information about whisker velocity. The prevalence of spiking non-linearities and feedforward inhibition in the nervous system suggests that the mechanisms for low network variability presented in our study may generalize throughout the brain.},

	abstract = {One of the first steps in the coding of olfactory information is the transformation of synaptic input to action potential firing in mitral and tufted ({M/T)} cells of the mammalian olfactory bulb. However, little is known regarding the synaptic mechanisms underlying this process in vivo. In this study, we examined odor-evoked response patterns of {M/T} and granule cells using whole-cell recording in anesthetized, freely breathing rats. We find that odor-evoked excitatory responses in {M/T} cells typically consist of bursts of action potentials coupled to the ∼2 Hz respiration rhythm. Odor-evoked, rhythmic {M/T} cell excitation is reliable during odor presentation (2–4 sec); in contrast, both excitatory responses of granule cells and {M/T} cell lateral inhibition adapt quickly after the first respiration cycle in the presence of odorants. We also find that the amplitude and initial slope of odor-evoked synaptic excitation play an important role in regulating the timing of {M/T} cell spikes. Furthermore, differences in odor concentration alter the shape of odor-evoked excitatory synaptic responses, the latency of {M/T} cell spikes, and the timing of {M/T} cell lateral inhibition.},

	abstract = {Spike synchronization underlies information processing and storage in the brain. But how can neurons synchronize in a noisy network? By exploiting a high-speed (500–2,000 fps) multineuron imaging technique and a large-scale synapse mapping method, we directly compared spontaneous activity patterns and anatomical connectivity in hippocampal {CA3} networks ex vivo. As compared to unconnected pairs, synaptically coupled neurons shared more common presynaptic neurons, received more correlated excitatory synaptic inputs, and emitted synchronized spikes with approximately 10 times higher probability. Importantly, common presynaptic parents per se synchronized more than unshared upstream neurons. Consistent with this, dynamic-clamp stimulation revealed that common inputs alone could not account for the realistic degree of synchronization unless presynaptic spikes synchronized among common parents. On a macroscopic scale, network activity was coordinated by a power-law scaling of synchronization, which engaged varying sets of densely interwired (thus highly synchronized) neuron groups. Thus, locally coherent activity converges on specific cell assemblies, thereby yielding complex ensemble dynamics. These segmentally synchronized pulse packets may serve as information modules that flow in associatively parallel network channels.},

According to Barlow’s seminal “efficient coding hypothesis,” the coding strategy of sensory neurons should be matched to the statistics of stimuli that occur in an animal’s natural habitat. Using an automatic search technique, we here test this hypothesis and identify stimulus ensembles that sensory neurons are optimized for. Focusing on grasshopper auditory receptor neurons, we find that their optimal stimulus ensembles differ from the natural environment, but largely overlap with a behaviorally important sub-ensemble of the natural sounds. This indicates that the receptors are optimized for peak rather than average performance. More generally, our results suggest that the coding strategies of sensory neurons are heavily influenced by differences in behavioral relevance among natural stimuli.},

The importance of uncontrolled events has been argued from the differences between isogenic organisms reared in virtually identical environments, but these might alternatively be attributed to subtle, undetected differences in the environment. The present review focuses on the uncontrolled events themselves in the context of the developing brain. These are considered at cellular and circuit levels because even if cellular physiology was perfectly controlled by the genes (which it is not), the interactions between different cells might still be uncoordinated. A further complication is that the brain contains mechanisms that buffer noise and others that amplify it. The final resultant of the battle between these contrary mechanisms is that developmental stochasticity is sufficiently low to make neurobehavioural defects uncommon, but a chance component of neural development remains. Thus, our brains and behaviour are not entirely determined by a combination of genes-plus-environment.},

These dynamics are central to many models of olfactory information processing. We have found previously that sensory inputs to the olfactory bulb change both their magnitude and temporal structure as a function of sniff frequency. Here, we ask how sniff frequency affects responses of mitral/tufted ({MT)} cells—the principal olfactory bulb output neurons. We recorded from {MT} cells in anesthetized rats while reproducing sniffs recorded previously from awake animals and varying sniff frequency. The dynamics of a sniff-evoked response were consistent from sniff to sniff but varied across cells. Compared to the dynamics of receptor neuron activation by the same sniffs, the {MT} response was shorter and faster, reflecting a temporal sharpening of sensory inputs. Increasing sniff frequency led to moderate attenuation of {MT} response magnitude and significant changes in the temporal structure of the sniff-evoked {MT} cell response. Most {MT} cells responded with a shorter duration and shorter rise-time spike burst as sniff frequency increased, reflecting increased temporal sharpening of inputs by the olfactory bulb. These temporal changes were necessary and sufficient to maintain respiratory modulation in the {MT} cell population across the range of sniff frequencies expressed during behavior. These results suggest that the input–output relationship in the olfactory bulb varies dynamically as a function of sniff frequency and that one function of the postsynaptic network is to maintain robust temporal encoding of odor information across different odor sampling strategies.},

A critical feature of neural computation is the ability for neurons to modulate their spike train response to a given input, allowing task context or past history to affect the flow of information in the brain. The mechanisms that modulate the input-output transfer of single neurons have received significant attention. However, neural computation involves the coordinated activity of populations of neurons, and the mechanisms that modulate the correlation between spike trains from pairs of neurons are relatively unexplored. We show that the level of excitatory and inhibitory input that a neuron receives modulates not only the sensitivity of a single neuron's response to input, but also the magnitude and timescale of correlated spiking activity of pairs of neurons receiving a common synaptic drive. Thus, while modulatory synaptic activity has been traditionally studied from a single neuron perspective, it can also shape the coordinated activity of a population of neurons.},

	abstract = {The hippocampal formation is believed to be critical for the encoding, consolidation, and retrieval of episodic memories. Yet, how these processes are supported by the anatomically diverse hippocampal networks is still unknown. To examine this issue, we tested rats in a hippocampus-dependent delayed spatial alternation task on a modified T maze while simultaneously recording local field potentials from dendritic and somatic layers of the dentate gyrus, {CA3}, and {CA1} regions by using high-density, 96-site silicon probes. Both the power and coherence of gamma oscillations exhibited layer-specific changes during task performance. Peak increases in the gamma power and coherence were found in the {CA3–CA1} interface on the maze segment approaching the T junction, independent of motor aspects of task performance. These results show that hippocampal networks can be dynamically coupled by gamma oscillations according to specific behavioral demands. Based on these findings, we propose that gamma oscillations may serve as a physiological mechanism by which {CA3} output can coordinate {CA1} activity to support retrieval of hippocampus-dependent memories.},

	abstract = {Glomeruli are functional units in the olfactory system. The mouse olfactory bulb contains roughly 2,000 glomeruli, each receiving inputs from olfactory sensory neurons ({OSNs)} that express a specific odorant receptor gene. Odors typically activate many glomeruli in complex combinatorial patterns and it is unknown which features of neuronal activity in individual glomeruli contribute to odor perception. To address this, we used optogenetics to selectively activate single, genetically identified glomeruli in behaving mice. We found that mice could perceive the stimulation of a single glomerulus. Single-glomerulus stimulation was also detected on an intense odor background. In addition, different input intensities and the timing of input relative to sniffing were discriminated through one glomerulus. Our data suggest that each glomerulus can transmit odor information using identity, intensity and temporal coding cues. These multiple modes of information transmission may enable the olfactory system to efficiently identify and localize odor sources.},

This low amplification is in contrast to rod phototransduction in vision, the best-quantified G-protein signaling pathway, where each photoisomerized rhodopsin molecule is well known to produce substantial amplification by activating many G-protein, and hence effector-enzyme, molecules. We have now carried out similar experiments on mouse {ORNs}, which offer, additionally, the advantage of genetics. Indeed, we found the same low probability of transduction, based on the unitary olfactory response having a fairly constant amplitude and similar kinetics across different odorants and randomly encountered {ORNs.} Also, consistent with our picture, the unitary response of Gαolf+/− {ORNs} was similar to {WT} in amplitude, although their Gαolf-protein expression was only half of normal. Finally, from the action potential firing, we estimated that ≤19 odorant-binding events successfully triggering transduction in a {WT} mouse {ORN} will lead to signaling to the brain.},

Oscillations and resonance in the {CNS} are proposed to have diverse functional roles, such as (i) determining global functional states (for example, sleep-wakefulness or attention), (ii) timing in motor coordination, and (iii) specifying connectivity during development. Also, oscillation, especially in the thalamo-cortical circuits, may be related to certain neurological and psychiatric disorders.

These methods have also been applied to characterize the input-output relations of single neurons driven by synaptic inputs, simulated by direct current injection. To interpret the results of white noise analysis of single neurons, we would like to understand how the obtained feature space of a single neuron maps onto the biophysical properties of the membrane, in particular, the dynamics of ion channels. Here, through analysis of a simple dynamical model neuron, we draw explicit connections between the output of a white noise analysis and the underlying dynamical system. We find that under certain assumptions, the form of the relevant features is well defined by the parameters of the dynamical system. Further, we show that under some conditions, the feature space is spanned by the spike-triggered average and its successive order time derivatives.},

We find that unbalanced synaptic excitation and inhibition underlie sparse activity: inhibition is widespread and broadly tuned, while excitation is less common and odor-specific. {"Global"} inhibition can be explained by local interneurons that receive ubiquitous and nonselective odor-evoked excitation. In the temporal domain, while respiration imposes a slow rhythm to olfactory cortical responses, odors evoke fast (15-30 Hz) oscillations in synaptic activity. Oscillatory excitation precedes inhibition, generating brief time windows for precise and temporally sparse spike output. Together, our results reveal that global inhibition and oscillations are major synaptic mechanisms shaping odor representations in olfactory cortex.},

Two critical factors affect the integrative function of dendrites: the distribution of voltage-gated ion channels in the dendritic tree and the passive electrical properties, or 'electrotonic structure', upon which these active channels are superimposed. The authors review recent data from patch-clamp recordings that provide new estimates of the passive membrane properties of hippocampal neurons, and show, with examples, how these properties affect the shaping and attenuation of synaptic potentials as they propagate in the dendrites, as well as how they affect the measurement of current from synapses located in the dendrites.

J. Neurophysiol. 77: 621–631, 1997. The excitability of layer V cortical pyramidal neurons was studied in vitro in the single-locus mutant mouse stargazer (stg), a genetic model of spike wave epilepsy. Field recordings in neocortical slices from mutant mice bathed in artificial cerebrospinal fluid revealed spontaneous synchronous network discharges that were never present in wild-type slices. Intracellular and whole cell recordings from stg/stg neurons in deep layers showed spontaneous giant depolarizing excitatory postsynaptic potentials generating bursts of action potentials, and a 78\% reduction in the afterburst hyperpolarization. Whole cell recordings revealed gene-linked differences in active membrane properties in two types of regular spiking neurons. Single action potential rise and decay times were reduced, and the rheobase current was decreased by 68\% in mutant cells. Plots of spike frequency-current relationships revealed that the gain of this relation was augmented by 29\% in the mutant. Comparisons of visually identified pyramidal neuron firing properties in both genotypes revealed no difference in single action potential afterhyperpolarization. Voltage-clamp recordings showed an approximately threefold amplitude increase in a cesium-sensitive inward rectifier. No cell density or soma size differences were observed in the layer V pyramidal neuron population between the two genotypes. These results demonstrate an autonomous increase in cortical network excitability in a genetic epilepsy model. This defect could lower the threshold for aberrant thalamocortical spike wave oscillations in vivo, and may contribute to the mechanism of one form of inherited absence epilepsy.},

In principle, an explicit formula gives the probability density of a single spike train in great generality, but without additional assumptions, the firing-rate intensity function appearing in that formula cannot be estimated. We propose a simple solution to this problem, which is to assume that the time at which a neuron fires is determined probabilistically by, and only by, two quantities: the experimental clock time and the elapsed time since the previous spike. We show that this model can be fitted with standard methods and software and that it may used successfully to fit neuronal data.},

Here, we develop analytic approaches toward answering how neuron-level variation in intrinsic biophysical properties of olfactory bulb mitral cells influences population coding of fluctuating stimuli. We capture the intrinsic diversity of recorded populations of neurons through a statistical approach based on generalized linear models. These models are flexible enough to predict the diverse responses of individual neurons yet provide a common reference frame for comparing one neuron to the next. We then use Bayesian stimulus decoding to ask how effectively different populations of mitral cells, varying in their diversity, encode a common stimulus. We show that a key advantage provided by physiological levels of intrinsic diversity is more efficient and more robust encoding of stimuli by the population as a whole. However, we find that the populations that best encode stimulus features are not simply the most heterogeneous, but those that balance diversity with the benefits of neural similarity.},

Four studies reported olfactory receptor activity, seven reported glomerulus activity, and one reported the activity of projection-neurons. We found two linear axes of neural population activity that accounted for more than half of the variance in neural response across species. The first axis was correlated with the total sum of odor-induced neural activity, and reflected the behavior of approach or withdrawal in animals, and odorant pleasantness in humans. The second and orthogonal axis reflected odorant toxicity across species. We conclude that in parallel with spatiotemporal pattern coding, the olfactory system can use simple global computations to read vital olfactory information from the neural population response.},

We found that fear conditioning in mice induced robust plasticity of excitatory synapses onto inhibitory neurons in the lateral subdivision of the {CeA} ({CeL).} This experience-dependent plasticity was cell specific, bidirectional and expressed presynaptically by inputs from the lateral amygdala. In particular, preventing synaptic potentiation onto somatostatin-positive neurons impaired fear memory formation. Furthermore, activation of these neurons was necessary for fear memory recall and was sufficient to drive fear responses. Our findings support a model in which fear conditioning–induced synaptic modifications in {CeL} favor the activation of somatostatin-positive neurons, which inhibit {CeL} output, thereby disinhibiting the medial subdivision of {CeA} and releasing fear expression.},

Cyclical depolarizations were generated by glutamate activation of dendritic autoreceptors, while the slow frequency was determined primarily by the duration of regenerative glutamate release. Patterned stimuli elicited stimulus-entrained oscillations that amplified weak and variable inputs.

For example, the density of {HCN1} subunits in pyramidal cells increases 60-fold from soma to distal dendrites but is uniform over the somato-dendritic surface of olfactory bulb external tufted cells and is highest in the axon of cortical and cerebellar basket cells.

The ability to generate short-duration action potentials at high frequencies depends on the expression of specific voltage-gated K+ channels. Factors facilitating fast action potential initiation following synaptic excitation include depolarized interneuron resting potential, subthreshold conductances and active dendrites. Finally, {GABA} release at interneuron output synapses is rapid and highly synchronized, leading to a faster inhibition in postsynaptic interneurons than in principal cells.

	abstract = {Historically, papers have been physically bound to the journal in which they were published; but in the digital age papers are available individually, no longer tied to their respective journals. Hence, papers now can be read and cited based on their own merits, independently of the journal's physical availability, reputation, or impact factor ({IF).} We compare the strength of the relationship between journals' {IFs} and the actual citations received by their respective papers from 1902 to 2009. Throughout most of the 20th century, papers' citation rates were increasingly linked to their respective journals' {IFs.} However, since 1990, the advent of the digital age, the relation between {IFs} and paper citations has been weakening. This began first in physics, a field that was quick to make the transition into the electronic domain. Furthermore, since 1990 the overall proportion of highly cited papers coming from highly cited journals has been decreasing and, of these highly cited papers, the proportion not coming from highly cited journals has been increasing. Should this pattern continue, it might bring an end to the use of the {IF} as a way to evaluate the quality of journals, papers, and researchers.},

	abstract = {Neurophysiologists are often faced with the problem of evaluating the quality of a code for a sensory or motor variable, either to relate it to the performance of the animal in a simple discrimination task or to compare the codes at various stages along the neuronal pathway. One common belief that has emerged from such studies is that sharpening of tuning curves improves the quality of the code, although only to a certain point; sharpening beyond that is believed to be harmful. We show that this belief relies on either problematic technical analysis or improper assumptions about the noise. We conclude that one cannot tell, in the general case, whether narrow tuning curves are better than wide ones; the answer depends critically on the covariance of the noise. The same conclusion applies to other manipulations of the tuning curve profiles such as gain increase.},

At the network level, populations of neurons have been observed to make these transitions synchronously. Although synaptic activity and intrinsic neuron properties play an important role, the precise nature of the processes responsible for these phenomena is not known. Using a computational model, we explore the interplay between intrinsic neuronal properties and synaptic fluctuations. Model neurons of the integrate-and-fire type were extended by adding a nonlinear membrane current. Networks of these neurons exhibit large amplitude synchronous spontaneous fluctuations that make the neurons jump between up and down states, thereby producing bimodal membrane potential distributions. The effect of sensory stimulation on network responses depends on whether the stimulus is applied during an up state or deeply inside a down state. External noise can be varied to modulate the network continuously between two extreme regimes in which it remains permanently in either the up or the down state.},

The ideal recording device would be a nanoscale machine capable of quantitatively transducing a wide range of variables into a molecular recording medium suitable for long-term storage and facile readout in the form of digital data. We have recently proposed such a device, in which cation concentrations modulate the misincorporation rate of a {DNA} polymerase ({DNAP)} on a known template, allowing {DNA} sequences to encode information about the local cation concentration. In this work we quantify the cation sensitivity of {DNAP} misincorporation rates, making possible the indirect readout of cation concentration by {DNA} sequencing. Using multiplexed deep sequencing, we quantify the misincorporation properties of two {DNA} polymerases – Dpo4 and Klenow exo− – obtaining the probability and base selectivity of misincorporation at all positions within the template. We find that Dpo4 acts as a {DNA} recording device for Mn2+ with a misincorporation rate gain of {∼2\%/mM.} This modulation of misincorporation rate is selective to the template base: the probability of misincorporation on template T by Dpo4 increases {\textgreater}50-fold over the range tested, while the other template bases are affected less strongly. Furthermore, cation concentrations act as scaling factors for misincorporation: on a given template base, Mn2+ and Mg2+ change the overall misincorporation rate but do not alter the relative frequencies of incoming misincorporated nucleotides. Characterization of the ion dependence of {DNAP} misincorporation serves as the first step towards repurposing it as a molecular recording device.},

	abstract = {1. Perforated patch-clamp recordings were made from the three major classes of hippocampal neurons in conventional in vitro slices prepared from adult guinea pigs. This technique provided experimental estimates of passive membrane properties (input resistance, {RN}, and membrane time constant, tau m) determined in the absence of the leak conductance associated with microelectrode impalement or the washout of cytoplasmic constituents associated with conventional whole-cell recordings. 2. To facilitate comparison of our data with previous results and to determine the passive membrane properties under conditions as physiological as possible, recordings were made at the resting potential, in physiological saline, and without any added blockers of voltage-dependent conductances. 3. Membrane-potential responses to current steps were analyzed, and four criteria were used to identify voltage responses that were the least affected by activation of voltage-dependent conductances. tau m was estimated from the slowest component (tau 0) of multiexponential fits of responses deemed passive by these criteria. {RN} was estimated from the slope of the linear region in the hyperpolarizing direction of the voltage-current relation. 4. It was not possible to measure purely passive membrane properties that were completely independent of membrane potential in any of the three classes of hippocampal neurons. Changing the membrane potential by constant current injection resulted in changes in {RN} and tau 0; subthreshold depolarization produced an increase, and hyperpolarization a decrease, in both {RN} and tau 0 for all three classes of hippocampal neurons. 5. Each of the three classes of hippocampal neurons also displayed a depolarizing "sag" during larger hyperpolarizing voltage transients. To evaluate the effect of the conductances underlying this sag on passive membrane properties, 2-5 {mM} Cs+ was added to the physiological saline. Extracellular Cs+ effectively blocked the sag in all three classes of hippocampal neurons, but the effect of Cs+ on {RN}, tau 0, and the voltage dependence of these parameters was unique for each class of neurons. 6. {CA1} pyramidal neurons had an {RN} of 104 +/- 10 ({SE)} M omega and tau 0 of 28 +/- 2 ms at a resting potential of -64 +/- 2 {mV} (n = 12). {RN} and tau 0 were larger at more depolarized potentials in these neurons, but the addition of Cs+ to the physiological saline reversed this voltage dependence. 7. {CA3} pyramidal neurons had an {RN} of 135 +/- 8 M omega and tau 0 of 66 +/- 4 ms at a resting potential of -64 +/- 1 {mV} (n = 14).({ABSTRACT} {TRUNCATED} {AT} 400 {WORDS)}},

The aim of this study was to determine whether neuronal activity in the macaque supplementary eye field ({SEF)} is influenced by the rule used for saccadic target selection. Two monkeys were trained to perform a variant of the memory-guided saccade task in which any of four visible dots (rightward, upward, leftward, and downward) could be the target. On each trial, the cue identifying the target was either a spot flashed in superimposition on the target (spatial condition) or a foveally presented digitized image associated with the target (pattern condition). Trials conforming to the two conditions were interleaved randomly. On recording from 439 {SEF} neurons, we found that two aspects of neuronal activity were influenced by the nature of the cue. 1) Activity reflecting the direction of the impending response developed more rapidly following spatial than following pattern cues. 2) Activity throughout the delay period tended to be higher following pattern than following spatial cues. We consider these findings in relation to the possible involvement of the {SEF} in processes underlying attention, arousal, response-selection, and motor preparation.},

Most neurons are highly polarized cells with branched dendrites that receive and integrate synaptic inputs and extensive axons that deliver action potential output to distant targets. By contrast, amacrine cells, a diverse class of inhibitory interneurons in the inner retina, collect input and distribute output within the same neuritic network. The extent to which most amacrine cells integrate synaptic information and distribute their output is poorly understood. Here, we show that single A17 amacrine cells provide reciprocal feedback inhibition to presynaptic bipolar cells via hundreds of independent microcircuits operating in parallel. The A17 uses specialized morphological features, biophysical properties, and synaptic mechanisms to isolate feedback microcircuits and maximize its capacity to handle many independent processes. This example of a neuron employing distributed parallel processing rather than spatial integration provides insights into how unconventional neuronal morphology and physiology can maximize network function while minimizing wiring cost.},

	abstract = {Efficient sensory coding implies that populations of neurons should represent information-rich aspects of a signal with little redundancy. Recent studies have shown that neural heterogeneity in higher brain areas enhances the efficiency of encoding by reducing redundancy across the population. Here, we study how neural heterogeneity in the early stages of sensory processing influences the efficiency of population codes. Through the analysis of in vivo recordings, we contrast the encoding of two types of communication signals of electric fishes in the most peripheral sensory area of the {CNS}, the electrosensory lateral line lobe ({ELL).} We show that communication signals used during courtship (big chirps) and during aggressive encounters (small chirps) are encoded by different populations of {ELL} pyramidal cells, namely I-cells and E-cells, respectively. Most importantly, we show that the encoding strategy differs for the two signals and we argue that these differences allow these cell types to encode specifically information-rich features of the signals. Small chirps are detected, and their timing is accurately signaled through stereotyped spike bursts, whereas the shape of big chirps is accurately represented by variable increases in firing rate. Furthermore, we show that the heterogeneity across I-cells enhances the efficiency of the population code and thus permits the accurate discrimination of different quality courtship signals. Our study shows the importance of neural heterogeneity early in a sensory system and that it initiates the sparsification of sensory representation thereby contributing to the efficiency of the neural code.},

The beta frequency is able to synchronize over long conduction delays (corresponding to signals traveling a significant distance in the brain) that apparently cannot be tolerated by gamma rhythms.

Parvalbumin-positive fast-spiking ({FS)} interneurons are a particularly specialized cortical cell-type that controls the dynamics of ongoing activity and prevents runaway excitation by virtue of remarkably high firing rates, a feature that is permitted by narrow action potentials and the absence of spike-frequency adaptation. Although several neuronal intrinsic membrane properties undergo activity-dependent plasticity, the role of network activity in shaping and maintaining specialized, cell-type-specific firing properties is unknown. We tested whether the specialized firing properties of mature {FS} interneurons are sensitive to activity perturbations by inactivating a portion of motor cortex in vivo for 48 h and measuring resulting plasticity of {FS} intrinsic and firing properties with whole-cell recording in acute slices. Many of the characteristic properties of {FS} interneurons, including nonadapting high-frequency spiking and narrow action potentials, were profoundly affected by activity deprivation both at an age just after maturation of {FS} firing properties and also a week after their maturation. Using microarray screening, we determined that although normal maturation of {FS} electrophysiological specializations is accompanied by large-scale transcriptional changes, the effects of deprivation on the same specializations involve more modest transcriptional changes, and may instead be primarily mediated by post-transcriptional mechanisms.},

	abstract = {The tactile sensations mediated by the whisker-trigeminal system allow rodents to efficiently detect and discriminate objects. These capabilities rely strongly on the temporal and spatial structure of whisker deflections. Subthreshold but also spiking receptive fields in the barrel cortex encompass a large number of vibrissae, and it seems likely that the functional properties of these multiwhisker receptive fields reflect the multiple-whisker interactions encountered by the animal during exploration of its environment. The aim of this study was to examine the dependence of the spatial structure of cortical receptive fields on stimulus parameters. Using a newly developed 24-whisker stimulation matrix, we applied a forward correlation analysis of spiking activity to randomized whisker deflections (sparse noise) to characterize the receptive fields that result from caudal and rostral directions of whisker deflection. We observed that the functionally determined principal whisker, the whisker eliciting the strongest response with the shortest latency, differed according to the direction of whisker deflection. Thus, for a given neuron, maximal responses to opposite directions of whisker deflections could be spatially separated. This spatial separation resulted in a displacement of the center of mass between the rostral and caudal subfields and was accompanied by differences between response latencies in rostral and caudal directions of whisker deflection. Such direction-dependent receptive field organization was observed in every cortical layer. We conclude that the spatial structure of receptive fields in the barrel cortex is not an intrinsic property of the neuron but depends on the properties of sensory input.},

	abstract = {The primate visual system continuously selects spatial proscribed regions, features or objects for further processing. These selection mechanisms--collectively termed selective visual attention--are guided by intrinsic, bottom-up and by task-dependent, top-down signals. While much psychophysical research has shown that overt and covert attention is partially allocated based on saliency-driven exogenous signals, it is unclear how this is accomplished at the neuronal level. Recent electrophysiological experiments in monkeys point to the gradual emergence of saliency signals when ascending the dorsal visual stream and to the influence of top-down attention on these signals. To elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying these observations, we construct a biologically plausible network of spiking neurons to simulate the formation of saliency signals in different cortical areas. We find that saliency signals are rapidly generated through lateral excitation and inhibition in successive layers of neural populations selective to a single feature. These signals can be improved by feedback from a higher cortical area that represents a saliency map. In addition, we show how top-down attention can affect the saliency signals by disrupting this feedback through its action on the saliency map. While we find that saliency computations require dominant slow {NMDA} currents, the signal rapidly emerges from successive regions of the network. In conclusion, using a detailed spiking network model we find biophysical mechanisms and limitations of saliency computations which can be tested experimentally.},

These neurons lock their action potentials to incoming stimuli with a high degree of temporal precision. Channels with unitary properties similar to those of Slack and/or Slick channels, which are gated by [Na+]i and [Cl-]i and by changes in cytoplasmic {ATP} levels, are present in {MNTB} neurons.

In the process, neurons can either achieve a more efficient stimulus representation, or extract some biologically important stimulus parameter, or succeed at both. We recorded the inputs from single retinal ganglion cells and the outputs from connected lateral geniculate neurons in the macaque to examine how visual signals are relayed from retina to cortex. We found that geniculate neurons re-encoded multiple temporal stimulus features to yield output spikes that carried more information about stimuli than was available in each input spike. The coding transformation of some relay neurons occurred with no decrement in information rate, despite output spike rates that averaged half the input spike rates. This preservation of transmitted information was achieved by the short-term summation of inputs that geniculate neurons require to spike. A reduced model of the retinal and geniculate visual responses, based on two stimulus features and their associated nonlinearities, could account for {\textgreater}85\% of the total information available in the spike trains and the preserved information transmission. These results apply to neurons operating on a single time-varying input, suggesting that synaptic temporal integration can alter the temporal receptive field properties to create a more efficient representation of visual signals in the thalamus than the retina.},

We argue that odorants densely sample a two-dimensional curved surface embedded in the multidimensional sensory space. This surface can account for more than half of the variance of the perceptual data. We also show that only 12\% of experimental variance cannot be explained by curved surfaces of substantially small dimensionality ({\textless}10). We suggest that these curved manifolds represent the relevant spaces sampled by the human olfactory system, thereby providing surrogates for olfactory sensory space. For the case of {2D} approximation, we relate the two parameters on the curved surface to the physico-chemical parameters of odorant molecules. We show that one of the dimensions is related to eigenvalues of molecules' connectivity matrix, while the other is correlated with measures of molecules' polarity.

Recently, descriptions of interneuron variability were standardized by multiple laboratories on the basis of a subjective classification scheme as set out by the Petilla convention (Petilla Interneuron Nomenclature Group, {PING).} Here, we present a quantitative, statistical analysis of a database of nearly five hundred neurons manually annotated according to the {PING} nomenclature. For each cell, 38 features were extracted from responses to suprathreshold current stimuli and statistically analyzed to examine whether cortical interneurons subdivide into e-types. We showed that the partitioning into different e-types is indeed the major component of data variability. The analysis suggests refining the {PING} e-type classification to be hierarchical, whereby most variability is first captured within a coarse subpartition, and then subsequently divided into finer subpartitions. The coarse partition matches the well-known partitioning of interneurons into fast spiking and adapting cells. Finer subpartitions match the burst, continuous, and delayed subtypes. Additionally, our analysis enabled the ranking of features according to their ability to differentiate among e-types. We showed that our quantitative e-type assignment is more than 90\% accurate and manages to catch several human errors.},

	abstract = {Neuronal firing is known to depend on the variance of synaptic input as well as the mean input current. Several studies suggest that input variance, or “noise,” has a divisive effect, reducing the slope or gain of the firing frequency–current ({f–I)} relationship. We measured the effects of current noise on {f–I} relationships in pyramidal neurons and fast-spiking ({FS)} interneurons in slices of rat sensorimotor cortex. In most pyramidal neurons, noise had a multiplicative effect on the steady-state {f–I} relationship, increasing gain. In contrast, noise reduced gain in {FS} interneurons. Gain enhancement in pyramidal neurons increased with stimulus duration and was correlated with the amplitude of the slow afterhyperpolarization ({sAHP)}, a major mechanism of spike-frequency adaptation. The 5-{HT2} receptor agonist α-methyl-5-{HT} reduced the {sAHP} and eliminated gain increases, whereas augmenting the {sAHP} conductance by spike-triggered dynamic-current clamp enhanced the gain increase. These results indicate that the effects of noise differ fundamentally between classes of neocortical neurons, depending on specific biophysical properties including the {sAHP} conductance. Thus, noise from background synaptic input may enhance network excitability by increasing gain in pyramidal neurons with large {sAHPs} and reducing gain in inhibitory {FS} interneurons.},

Our method maintained a constant sample volume during the clearing procedure, an important factor for keeping cellular morphology intact, and facilitated the quantitative reconstruction of neuronal circuits. Combined with two-photon microscopy and an optimized objective lens, we were able to image the mouse brain from the dorsal to the ventral side. We used {SeeDB} to describe the near-complete wiring diagram of sister mitral cells associated with a common glomerulus in the mouse olfactory bulb. We found the diversity of dendrite wiring patterns among sister mitral cells, and our results provide an anatomical basis for non-redundant odor coding by these neurons. Our simple and efficient method is useful for imaging intact morphological architecture at large scales in both the adult and developing brains.},

	abstract = {Adult-born neurons ({ABNs)} are added to the olfactory bulb ({OB)} throughout life in rodents. While many factors have been identified as regulating the survival and integration of {ABNs} into existing circuitry, the understanding of how these factors affect {ABN} morphology and connectivity is limited. Here we compare how cell intrinsic [small interfering {RNA} ({siRNA)} knock-down of voltage gated sodium channels {NaV1.1–1.3]} and circuit level (naris occlusion) reductions in activity affect {ABN} morphology during integration into the {OB.} We found that both manipulations reduce the number of dendritic spines (and thus likely the number of reciprocal synaptic connections) formed with the surrounding circuitry and inhibited dendritic ramification of {ABNs.} Further, we identified regions of {ABN} apical dendrites where the largest and most significant decreases occur following {siRNA} knock-down or naris occlusion. In {siRNA} knock-down cells, reduction of spines is observed in proximal regions of the apical dendrite. This suggests that distal regions of the dendrite may remain active independent of {NaV1.1–1.3} channel expression, perhaps facilitated by activation of T-type calcium channels and {NMDA} receptors. By contrast, circuit level reduction of activity by naris occlusion resulted in a global depression of spine number. Together, these results indicate that {ABNs} retain the ability to develop their typical overall morphological features regardless of experienced activity, and activity modulates the number and location of formed connections.},

	abstract = {A critical component of the Neuroscience Information Framework ({NIF)} project is a consistent, flexible terminology for describing and retrieving neuroscience-relevant resources. Although the original {NIF} specification called for a loosely structured controlled vocabulary for describing neuroscience resources, as the {NIF} system evolved, the requirement for a formally structured ontology for neuroscience with sufficient granularity to describe and access a diverse collection of information became obvious. This requirement led to the {NIF} standardized ({NIFSTD)} ontology, a comprehensive collection of common neuroscience domain terminologies woven into an ontologically consistent, unified representation of the biomedical domains typically used to describe neuroscience data (e.g., anatomy, cell types, techniques), as well as digital resources (tools, databases) being created throughout the neuroscience community. {NIFSTD} builds upon a structure established by the {BIRNLex}, a lexicon of concepts covering clinical neuroimaging research developed by the Biomedical Informatics Research Network ({BIRN)} project. Each distinct domain module is represented using the Web Ontology Language ({OWL).} As much as has been practical, {NIFSTD} reuses existing community ontologies that cover the required biomedical domains, building the more specific concepts required to annotate {NIF} resources. By following this principle, an extensive vocabulary was assembled in a relatively short period of time for {NIF} information annotation, organization, and retrieval, in a form that promotes easy extension and modification. We report here on the structure of the {NIFSTD}, and its predecessor {BIRNLex}, the principles followed in its construction and provide examples of its use within {NIF.}},

Although the mouse has become a prominent model for studying olfaction, little is known about sniffing behavior in mice. Here, we characterized mouse sniffing behavior by measuring intranasal pressure transients in behaving mice. Sniffing was monitored during unstructured exploratory behavior and during performance of 3 commonly used olfactory paradigms: a habituation/dishabituation task, a sand digging-based discrimination task, and a nose poke-based discrimination task. We found that respiration frequencies in quiescent mice ranged from 3 to 5 Hz--higher than that reported for rats. During exploration, sniff frequency increased up to approximately 12 Hz and was highly dynamic, with rapid changes in frequency, amplitude, and waveform. Sniffing behavior varied strongly between tasks as well as for different behavioral epochs of each task. For example, mice performing the digging-based task showed little increase in sniff frequency prior to digging, whereas mice performing a nose poke-based task showed robust increases. Mice showed large increases in sniff frequency prior to reward delivery in all tasks. Mice also showed increases in sniff frequency when nose poking in a nonodor-guided task. These results show that mouse sniffing behavior is highly dynamic, varies with behavioral context, and is strongly modulated by olfactory as well as nonolfactory events.},

While neuronal simulators such as {NEURON}, {GENESIS}, {MOOSE}, {NEST}, and {PSICS} facilitate the development of these data-driven neuronal models, the specialized languages they employ are generally not interoperable, limiting model accessibility and preventing reuse of model components and cross-simulator validation. To overcome these problems we have used an Open Source software approach to develop {NeuroML}, a neuronal model description language based on {XML} (Extensible Markup Language). This enables these detailed models and their components to be defined in a standalone form, allowing them to be used across multiple simulators and archived in a standardized format. Here we describe the structure of {NeuroML} and demonstrate its scope by converting into {NeuroML} models of a number of different voltage- and ligand-gated conductances, models of electrical coupling, synaptic transmission and short-term plasticity, together with morphologically detailed models of individual neurons. We have also used these {NeuroML-based} components to develop an highly detailed cortical network model. {NeuroML-based} model descriptions were validated by demonstrating similar model behavior across five independently developed simulators. Although our results confirm that simulations run on different simulators converge, they reveal limits to model interoperability, by showing that for some models convergence only occurs at high levels of spatial and temporal discretisation, when the computational overhead is high. Our development of {NeuroML} as a common description language for biophysically detailed neuronal and network models enables interoperability across multiple simulation environments, thereby improving model transparency, accessibility and reuse in computational neuroscience.},

We found significant redundancy between cells spaced as far as 500 mum apart. When we used standard methods for defining functional types, only {ON-type} and {OFF-type} cells emerged as truly independent information channels. Although the average redundancy between nearby cell pairs was moderate, each ganglion cell shared information with many neighbors, so that visual information was represented approximately 10-fold within the ganglion cell population. This high degree of retinal redundancy suggests that design principles beyond coding efficiency may be important at the population level.},

Extending prior work in mathematical finance, this generalized thinning and shift ({GTaS)} model creates marginally Poisson spike trains with diverse temporal correlation structures. We give several examples which highlight the model's flexibility and utility. For instance, we use it to examine how a neural network responds to highly structured patterns of inputs. We then show that the {GTaS} model is analytically tractable, and derive cumulant densities of all orders in terms of model parameters. The {GTaS} framework can therefore be an important tool in the experimental and theoretical exploration of neural dynamics.},

For different parameter values, the model produces spiking or bursting, tonic, phasic or adapting responses, depolarizing or hyperpolarizing after potentials and so forth. The model consists of a diagonalizable set of linear differential equations describing the time evolution of membrane potential, a variable threshold, and an arbitrary number of firing-induced currents. Each of these variables is modified by an update rule when the potential reaches threshold. The variables used are intuitive and have biological significance. The model's rich behavior does not come from the differential equations, which are linear, but rather from complex update rules. This single-neuron model can be implemented using algorithms similar to the standard integrate-and-fire model. It is a natural match with event-driven algorithms for which the firing times are obtained as a solution of a polynomial equation.},

Dendritic integration of these afferent signals is critical in determining the amplitude and time course of the neurons' output signals. As of yet, little is known about the spatial and temporal organization of converging sensory inputs. Here, we combined in vivo two-photon imaging with whole-cell recordings in layer 2 neurons of the mouse vibrissal cortex as a means to analyze the spatial pattern of subthreshold dendritic calcium signals evoked by the stimulation of different whiskers. We show that the principle whisker and the surrounding whiskers can evoke dendritic calcium transients in the same neuron. Distance-dependent attenuation of dendritic calcium transients and the corresponding subthreshold depolarization suggest feed-forward activation. We found that stimulation of different whiskers produced multiple calcium hotspots on the same dendrite. Individual hotspots were activated with low probability in a stochastic manner. We show that these hotspots are generated by calcium signals arising in dendritic spines. Some spines were activated uniquely by single whiskers, but many spines were activated by multiple whiskers. These shared spines indicate the existence of presynaptic feeder neurons that integrate and transmit activity arising from multiple whiskers. Despite the dendritic overlap of whisker-specific and shared inputs, different whiskers are represented by a unique set of activation patterns within the dendritic field of each neuron.},

Here we develop mean-field methods for approximating the stimulus-driven firing rates (in both the time-varying and steady-state cases), auto- and cross-correlations, and stimulus-dependent filtering properties of these networks. These approximations are valid when the contributions of individual network coupling terms are small and, hence, the total input to a neuron is approximately gaussian. These approximations lead to deterministic ordinary differential equations that are much easier to solve and analyze than direct Monte Carlo simulation of the network activity. These approximations also provide an analytical way to evaluate the linear input-output filter of neurons and how the filters are modulated by network interactions and some stimulus feature. Finally, in the case of strong refractory effects, the mean-field approximations in the generalized linear model become inaccurate; therefore, we introduce a model that captures strong refractoriness, retains all of the easy fitting properties of the standard generalized linear model, and leads to much more accurate approximations of mean firing rates and cross-correlations that retain fine temporal behaviors.},

	abstract = {Focused ultrasound is a promising noninvasive technology for neural stimulation. Here we use the isolated salamander retina to characterize the effect of ultrasound on an intact neural circuit and compared these effects with those of visual stimulation of the same retinal ganglion cells. Ultrasound stimuli at an acoustic frequency of 43 {MHz} and a focal spot diameter of 90 μm delivered from a piezoelectric transducer evoked stable responses with a temporal precision equal to strong visual responses but with shorter latency. By presenting ultrasound and visual stimulation together, we found that ultrasonic stimulation rapidly modulated visual sensitivity but did not change visual temporal filtering. By combining pharmacology with ultrasound stimulation, we found that ultrasound did not directly activate retinal ganglion cells but did in part activate interneurons beyond photoreceptors. These results suggest that, under conditions of strong localized stimulation, timing variability is largely influenced by cells beyond photoreceptors. We conclude that ultrasonic stimulation is an effective and spatiotemporally precise method to activate the retina. Because the retina is the most accessible part of the {CNS} in vivo, ultrasonic stimulation may have diagnostic potential to probe remaining retinal function in cases of photoreceptor degeneration, and therapeutic potential for use in a retinal prosthesis. In addition, because of its noninvasive properties and spatiotemporal resolution, ultrasound neurostimulation promises to be a useful tool to understand dynamic activity in pharmacologically defined neural pathways in the retina.},

For a given region, substructure, layer or even cell type, variability in neuronal morphology and connectivity persists. Although it is well known that such cellular properties vary considerably according to neuronal type, the substantial biophysical diversity of neurons of the same morphological class is typically averaged out and ignored. Here we show that the amplitude of hyperpolarization-evoked sag of membrane potential recorded in olfactory bulb mitral cells is an emergent, homotypic property of local networks and sensory information processing. Simultaneous whole-cell recordings from pairs of cells show that the amount of hyperpolarization-evoked sag potential and current (Ih) is stereotypic for mitral cells belonging to the same glomerular circuit. This is corroborated by a mosaic, glomerulus-based pattern of expression of the {HCN2} (hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channel 2) subunit of the Ih channel. Furthermore, inter-glomerular differences in both membrane potential sag and {HCN2} protein are diminished when sensory input to glomeruli is genetically and globally altered so that only one type of odorant receptor is universally expressed. Population diversity in this intrinsic property therefore reflects differential expression between local mitral cell networks processing distinct odour-related information.},

In the zebrafish olfactory bulb, subsets of output neurons (mitral cells) engage in synchronized oscillations during odour responses, but information about odour identity is contained mostly in non-oscillatory firing rate patterns. Using optogenetic manipulations and odour stimulation, we found that firing rate responses of neurons in the posterior zone of the dorsal telencephalon (Dp), a target area homologous to olfactory cortex, were largely insensitive to oscillatory synchrony of mitral cells because passive membrane properties and synaptic currents act as low-pass filters. Nevertheless, synchrony influenced spike timing. Moreover, Dp neurons responded primarily during the decorrelated steady state of mitral cell activity patterns. Temporal filtering therefore tunes Dp neurons to components of mitral cell activity patterns that are particularly informative about precise odour identity. These results demonstrate how temporal filtering can extract specific information from multiplexed neuronal codes.},

	abstract = {The dynamics of sensory input to the nervous system play a critical role in shaping higher-level processing. In the olfactory system, the dynamics of input from olfactory receptor neurons ({ORNs)} are poorly characterized and depend on multiple factors, including respiration-driven airflow through the nasal cavity, odorant sorption kinetics, receptor-ligand interactions between odorant and receptor, and the electrophysiological properties of {ORNs.} Here, we provide a detailed characterization of the temporal organization of {ORN} input to the mammalian olfactory bulb ({OB)} during natural respiration, using calcium imaging to monitor {ORN} input to the {OB} in awake, head-fixed rats expressing odor-guided behaviors. We report several key findings. First, across a population of homotypic {ORNs}, each inhalation of odorant evokes a burst of action potentials having a rise time of about 80 ms and a duration of about 100 ms. This rise time indicates a relatively slow, progressive increase in {ORN} activation as odorant flows through the nasal cavity. Second, the dynamics of {ORN} input differ among glomeruli and for different odorants and concentrations, but remain reliable across successive inhalations. Third, inhalation alone (in the absence of odorant) evokes {ORN} input to a significant fraction of {OB} glomeruli. Finally, high-frequency sniffing of odorant strongly reduces the temporal coupling between {ORN} inputs and the respiratory cycle. These results suggest that the dynamics of sensory input to the olfactory system may play a role in coding odor information and that, in the awake animal, strategies for processing odor information may change as a function of sampling behavior.},

Individual local circuits can also transform their frequency through changes in intrinsic neuronal properties and interactions with other oscillating microcircuits. Here we discuss a frequency transformation in which activity in two co-active local circuits may combine sequentially to generate a third frequency whose period is the concatenation sum of the original two. With such an interaction, the intrinsic periodicity in each component local circuit is preserved - alternate, single periods of each original rhythm form one period of a new frequency - suggesting a robust mechanism for combining information processed on multiple concurrent spatiotemporal scales.},

We show that closely located neocortical neurons display virtually identical fluctuations of the membrane potential during electrographic seizures, thus directly demonstrating a high degree of focal synchrony during paroxysmal activity. In addition to synaptic drives, the persistent Na+ current [{INa(p)]} and probably the high-threshold Ca2+ current contributed to the generation of paroxysmal depolarizing shifts ({PDSs)} during cortically driven seizures. Ca2+-activated K+ current [{IK(Ca)]} took also part in the control of the amplitude and duration of {PDSs.} The hyperpolarizing components of seizures largely depended on Cs+-sensitive K+ currents. {IK(Ca)} played a significant, while not exclusive, role in the mediation of hyperpolarizing potentials related to {EEG} “waves” during spike-wave seizures.

Understanding the fundamental properties of synaptic transmission between L4 neurons helps us gain a clear picture of how the neuronal network in L4 cooperates to process sensory information. In the present study, we have determined the underlying parameters that govern synaptic strength, such as quantal size, size of readily releasable vesicle pool, and release probability (Pr) of excitatory synaptic connections within L4 of the visual cortex (V1) and the somatosensory cortex (S1) in mice. Although only a single vesicle is released per release site under physiological conditions at V1 synapses, multivesicular release ({MVR)} is observed at S1 synapses. In addition, we observed a saturation of postsynaptic receptors at S1 synapses. Other synaptic properties are similar in both cortices. Dynamic clamp experiments suggest that higher Pr and {MVR} at S1 synapses lower the requirement of the number of synaptic inputs to generate postsynaptic action potentials. In addition, the slower decay of synaptic current and the intrinsic membrane properties of the postsynaptic neuron also contribute to the reliable transmission between S1 neurons.},

It is widely believed that information about the stimulus features is coded by a weighted average of the neural responses. Recent theoretical studies have shown that the information capacity of such a coding scheme is very limited in the presence of the experimentally observed pairwise correlations. However, central to the analysis of these studies was the assumption of a homogeneous population of neurons. Experimental findings show a considerable measure of heterogeneity in the response properties of different neurons. In this study, we investigate the effect of neuronal heterogeneity on the information capacity of a correlated population of neurons. We show that information capacity of a heterogeneous network is not limited by the correlated noise, but scales linearly with the number of cells in the population. This information cannot be extracted by the population vector readout, whose accuracy is greatly suppressed by the correlated noise. On the other hand, we show that an optimal linear readout that takes into account the neuronal heterogeneity can extract most of this information. We study analytically the nature of the dependence of the optimal linear readout weights on the neuronal diversity. We show that simple online learning can generate readout weights with the appropriate dependence on the neuronal diversity, thereby yielding efficient readout.},

Previous neurophysiological studies suggest that attention can alter the baseline or gain of neurons in extrastriate visual areas but that it cannot change tuning. This suggests that neurons in visual cortex function as labeled lines whose meaning does not depend on task demands. To test this common assumption, we used a system identification approach to measure spatial frequency and orientation tuning in area V4 during two attentionally demanding visual search tasks, one that required fixation and one that allowed free viewing during search. We found that spatial attention modulates response baseline and gain but does not alter tuning, consistent with previous reports. In contrast, feature-based attention often shifts neuronal tuning. These tuning shifts are inconsistent with the labeled-line model and tend to enhance responses to stimulus features that distinguish the search target. Our data suggest that V4 neurons behave as matched filters that are dynamically tuned to optimize visual search.},

	abstract = {The relations between the direction of two-dimensional arm movements and single cell discharge in area 5 were investigated during 49 penetrations into the superior parietal lobule of 3 monkeys. A significant variation of cell discharge with the direction of movement was observed in 182 of 212 cells that were related to arm movements. In 151/182 of these cells the frequency of discharge was highest during movements in a preferred direction, and decreased in an orderly fashion with movements made in directions farther and farther away from the preferred one; in 112/151 cells this variation in discharge was a sinusoidal function of the direction of movement. Preferred directions differed for different cells so that directional tuning curves overlapped partially. These results are similar to those described for cells in the motor cortex (Georgopoulos et al. 1982): this suggests that directional information may be processed in a similar way in these structures. Many cells in area 5 changed activity before the onset of movement, and several did so before the earliest electromyographic changes (63\% and 35\%, respectively, of the cells that showed an increase in activity with movements in the preferred direction). However, the distribution of onset times of the parietal cells lagged the corresponding one of the motor cortical cells by about 60 ms. This suggests that the early changes observed in the parietal cortex might represent a corollary discharge from the precentral motor fields, whereas later activity might reflect peripheral as well as central events.},

Models that learn via changes to connections help explain this organization. These models discover the structure in ensembles of items if learning of each item is gradual and interleaved with learning about other items. This suggests that the neocortex learns slowly to discover the structure in ensembles of experiences. The hippocampal system permits rapid learning of new items without disrupting this structure, and reinstatement of new memories interleaves them with others to integrate them into structured neocortical memory systems.},

Mammals sample odors by sniffing, a complex behavior that controls odorant access to receptor neurons. Whether sniffing shapes the neural code for odors remains unclear. We addressed this question by imaging receptor input to the olfactory bulb of awake rats performing odor discriminations that elicited different sniffing behaviors. High-frequency sniffing of an odorant attenuated inputs encoding that odorant, whereas lower sniff frequencies caused little attenuation. Odorants encountered later in a sniff bout were encoded as the combination of that odorant and the background odorant during low-frequency sniffing, but were encoded as the difference between the two odorants during high-frequency sniffing. Thus, sniffing controls an adaptive filter for detecting changes in the odor landscape. These data suggest an unexpected functional role for sniffing and show that sensory codes can be transformed by sampling behavior alone.},

Model-based analysis of the responses revealed different coding schemes according to the level of input correlation. With uncorrelated stimuli on 24 whiskers, we identified two distinct functional categories of neurons, analogous in the temporal domain to simple and complex cells of the primary visual cortex. With correlated stimuli, however, a complementary coding scheme emerged: two distinct cell populations, similar to reinforcing and antagonist neurons described in the higher visual area {MT}, responded specifically to correlations. We suggest that similar context-dependent coexisting coding strategies may be present in other sensory systems to adapt sensory integration to specific stimulus statistics.},

	abstract = {Gamma oscillations (40-100 Hz), originally seen in the olfactory bulb ({OB)}, have long been a defining characteristic of sensory coding in the olfactory system. This study proposes that gamma oscillations are of two types, associated with different behavioral features and synaptic origins within the {OB.} Local field potentials were recorded from rat and mouse {OBs} during various behavioral periods (immobility, alert motionlessness, exploration and odor discrimination). High frequency gamma activity (65-100 Hz) is shown to be correlated with the sniff cycle, initiated at the peak of inhalation and is called type 1 gamma. It is prominent during exploratory behavior, but also present during resting and trained odor discrimination. Low frequency gamma activity (35-65 Hz), called type 2 gamma, is not strongly correlated with the sniff cycle, is inhibited by the sniff onset and is prominent during alert immobility. Rest and alert immobility are characterized by alternating type 1 and type 2 gamma rhythms, while exploratory sniffing and odor discrimination show a dramatic decrease in type 2 gamma with a broadband increase in the power of type 1 gamma. Periods of alert immobility prior to odor discrimination in trained animals show dominance of type 2 gamma, with episodes lasting up to 0.5 second. Data from mice with selective deletion of granule cell inhibition in the {OB} show a selective loss of type 2 gamma with type 1 gamma dramatically enhanced during exploratory behavior, suggesting that mutual inhibition between granule cells or centrifugal inhibitory input drives type 2 gamma, and that the excitatory-inhibitory connections between mitral and granule cells likely drive type 1 gamma. Gamma activity is not a single type of oscillation, and the largest amplitude gamma bursts are often those associated with an attentive cognitive state rather than odor sniffing.},

In rat vibrissal cortex, slender-tufted neurons carry motion and phase information during active whisking, but remain inactive after passive whisker touch. In contrast, thick-tufted neurons reliably increase spiking preferably after passive touch. By reconstructing the {3D} patterns of intracortical axon projections from individual slender- and thick-tufted neurons, filled in vivo with biocytin, we were able to identify cell type-specific intracortical circuits that may encode whisker motion and touch. Individual slender-tufted neurons showed elaborate and dense innervation of supragranular layers of large portions of the vibrissal area (total length, 86.8 ± 5.5 mm). During active whisking, these long-range projections may modulate and phase-lock the membrane potential of dendrites in layers 2 and 3 to the whisking cycle. Thick-tufted neurons with soma locations intermingling with those of slender-tufted ones display less dense intracortical axon projections (total length, 31.6 ± 14.3 mm) that are primarily confined to infragranular layers. Based on anatomical reconstructions and previous measurements of spiking, we put forward the hypothesis that thick-tufted neurons in rat vibrissal cortex receive input of whisker motion from slender-tufted neurons onto their apical tuft dendrites and input of whisker touch from thalamic neurons onto their basal dendrites. During tactile-driven behavior, such as object location, near-coincident input from these two pathways may result in increased spiking activity of thick-tufted neurons and thus enhanced signaling to their subcortical targets.},

Previous studies have found several physiological correlates of attention in visual cortex, including larger responses for attended objects. However, it has been unclear whether these attention-related changes have a large impact on information about objects at the neural population level. To address this question, we trained monkeys to covertly deploy their visual attention from a central fixation point to one of three objects displayed in the periphery, and we decoded information about the identity and position of the objects from populations of ∼200 neurons from the inferior temporal cortex using a pattern classifier. The results show that before attention was deployed, information about the identity and position of each object was greatly reduced relative to when these objects were shown in isolation. However, when a monkey attended to an object, the pattern of neural activity, represented as a vector with dimensionality equal to the size of the neural population, was restored toward the vector representing the isolated object. Despite this nearly exclusive representation of the attended object, an increase in the salience of nonattended objects caused “bottom-up” mechanisms to override these “top-down” attentional enhancements. The method described here can be used to assess which attention-related physiological changes are directly related to object recognition, and should be helpful in assessing the role of additional physiological changes in the future.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Mutations in the voltage-gated sodium channel {SCN1A} gene are the main genetic cause of Dravet syndrome (previously called severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy or {SMEI).}
Objective: To characterise in more detail the mutation spectrum associated with Dravet syndrome.
Methods: A large series of 333 patients was screened using both direct sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification ({MLPA).} Non-coding regions of the gene that are usually not investigated were also screened.
Results: {SCN1A} point mutations were identified in 228 patients, 161 of which had not been previously reported. Missense mutations, either (1) altering a highly conserved amino acid of the protein, (2) transforming this conserved residue into a chemically dissimilar amino acid and/or (3) belonging to ion-transport sequences, were the most common mutation type. {MLPA} analysis of the 105 patients without point mutation detected a heterozygous microrearrangement of {SCN1A} in 14 additional patients; 8 were private, partial deletions and six corresponded to whole gene deletions, 0.15–2.9 Mb in size, deleting nearby genes. Finally, mutations in exon {5N} and in untranslated regions of the {SCN1A} gene that were conserved during evolution were excluded in the remaining negative patients.
Conclusion: These findings widely expand the {SCN1A} mutation spectrum identified and highlight the importance of screening the coding regions with both direct sequencing and a quantitative method. This mutation spectrum, including whole gene deletions, argues in favour of haploinsufficiency as the main mechanism responsible for Dravet syndrome.},

	abstract = {Visual, acoustic, and olfactory stimuli associated with a highly charged emotional situation take on the affective qualities of that situation. Where the emotional meaning of a given sensory experience is stored is a matter of debate. We found that excitotoxic lesions of auditory, visual, or olfactory secondary sensory cortices impaired remote, but not recent, fear memories in rats. Amnesia was modality-specific and not due to an interference with sensory or emotional processes. In these sites, memory persistence was dependent on ongoing protein kinase M\{zeta\} activity and was associated with an increased activity of layers {II-IV}, thus suggesting a synaptic strengthening of corticocortical connections. Lesions of the same areas left intact the memory of sensory stimuli not associated with any emotional charge. We propose that secondary sensory cortices support memory storage and retrieval of sensory stimuli that have acquired a behavioral salience with the experience.},

	abstract = {Activated neuronal groups typically engage in rhythmic synchronization in the gamma-frequency range (30-100 Hz). Experimental and modeling studies demonstrate that each gamma cycle is framed by synchronized spiking of inhibitory interneurons. Here, we review evidence suggesting that the resulting rhythmic network inhibition interacts with excitatory input to pyramidal cells such that the more excited cells fire earlier in the gamma cycle. Thus, the amplitude of excitatory drive is recoded into phase values of discharges relative to the gamma cycle. This recoding enables transmission and read out of amplitude information within a single gamma cycle without requiring rate integration. Furthermore, variation of phase relations can be exploited to facilitate or inhibit exchange of information between oscillating cell assemblies. The gamma cycle could thus serve as a fundamental computational mechanism for the implementation of a temporal coding scheme that enables fast processing and flexible routing of activity, supporting fast selection and binding of distributed responses.

Here we present a unified statistical analysis of 10 different datasets recorded from several different species and brain areas. We show how functional interactions between neurons may be used to predict spiking in each of these different areas, and find that, in many cases, modeling interactions between a small number of neurons yields better spike predictions than modeling each neuron's relationship to the outside world using tuning curves. Although these statistical results cannot be linked to specific network architectures, since the measured interactions between neurons are purely functional rather than anatomical, they suggest that modeling interactions between neurons will be a useful approach to understanding neural coding as electrophysiologists record from increasing numbers of neurons.},

In casting it in the encoding-decoding framework, we find that this model is too restrictive to describe fully the activities of units in population codes in higher processing areas, such as the medial temporal area. Under a more powerful model, the population activity can convey information not only about a single value of some quantity but also about its whole distribution, including its variance, and perhaps even the certainty the system has in the actual presence in the world of the entity generating this quantity. We propose a novel method for forming such probabilistic interpretations of population codes and compare it to the existing method.},

Investigating the task of discriminating the syllables /ra/ and /la/, we hypothesized that the more distinct a person's neural representations of those sounds were, the better their behavioral ability to discriminate them would be. Standard neuroimaging approaches are ill-suited to testing this hypothesis as they have problems differentiating between neural representations spatially intermingled within the same brain area. We therefore performed multi-voxel pattern-based analysis of the functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI)} activity elicited by these syllables, in native speakers of English and Japanese. In right primary auditory cortex, the statistical separability of these {fMRI} patterns predicted subjects' behavioral ability to tell the sounds apart, not only across groups but also across individuals. This opens up a new approach for identifying neural representations and for quantifying their task suitability.},

Little is known, however, about the functional properties of their output. Characterization of synaptic outputs from new neurons is essential to assess the functional impact of adult neurogenesis on mature circuits. Here, we used optogenetics to control neurotransmitter release from new neurons. We found that light-induced synaptic {GABA} release from adult-born neurons leads to profound modifications of postsynaptic target firing patterns. We revealed that functional output synapses form just after new cells acquire the faculty to spike, but most synapses were made a month later. Despite discrepancies in the timing of new synapse recruitment, the properties of postsynaptic signals remain constant. Remarkably, we found that all major cell types of the olfactory bulb circuit, including output neurons and several distinct subtypes of local interneurons, were contacted by adult-born neurons. Thus, this study provides new insights into how new neurons integrate into the adult neural network and may influence the sense of smell.},

In some situations, it would be advantageous for the nervous system to sample interpretations from a probability distribution rather than commit to a particular interpretation. In this study, we asked whether visual percepts correspond to samples from the probability distribution over image interpretations, a form of sampling that we refer to as Bayesian sampling. To test this idea, we manipulated pairs of sensory cues in a bistable display consisting of two superimposed moving drifting gratings, and we asked subjects to report their perceived changes in depth ordering. We report that the fractions of dominance of each percept follow the multiplicative rule predicted by Bayesian sampling. Furthermore, we show that attractor neural networks can sample probability distributions if input currents add linearly and encode probability distributions with probabilistic population codes.},

These {SNPs} were considered jointly when assessing their association with neuroimaging measures. We discovered 22 genes that passed genome-wide significance for influencing temporal lobe volume. This was a substantially greater number of significant genes compared to those found with standard, univariate {GWAS.} These top genes are all expressed in the brain and include genes previously related to brain function or neuropsychiatric disorders such as {MACROD2}, {SORCS2}, {GRIN2B}, {MAGI2}, {NPAS3}, {CLSTN2}, {GABRG3}, {NRXN3}, {PRKAG2}, {GAS7}, {RBFOX1}, {ADARB2}, {CHD4}, and {CDH13.} The top genes we identified with this method also displayed significant and widespread post hoc effects on voxelwise, tensor-based morphometry ({TBM)} maps of the temporal lobes. The most significantly associated gene was an autism susceptibility gene known as {MACROD2.} We were able to successfully replicate the effect of the {MACROD2} gene in an independent cohort of 564 young, Australian healthy adult twins and siblings scanned with {MRI} (mean age: 23.8 ± 2.2 {SD} years).

The {“HypothesisFinder”} approach outlined here provides a possible solution for making scientific speculation gathering more tractable. Using a dictionary of speculative patterns, {HypothesisFinder} detects, collates and analyzes published speculative statements for a specific context. This can be extremely useful, particularly in reference to complex and poorly understood diseases like Alzheimer's disease. For example, by formulating a series of reasonable speculations on causes and effects, we could gain new insights into the directions of Alzheimer's disease etiology and progression.

Branch points in apical trees exhibit wide ranges of sizes and shapes, and the large diameter ratio between trunk and oblique dendrites exacerbates impedance mismatch. The morphological diversity of dendritic bifurcations could thus locally tune neuronal excitability and signal integration. However, these aspects have never been investigated. Here, we first quantified the morphological variability of branch points from two-photon images of rat {CA1} pyramidal neurons. We then investigated the geometrical features affecting spike initiation, propagation, and timing with a computational model validated by glutamate uncaging experiments. The results suggest that even subtle membrane readjustments at branch points could drastically alter the ability of synaptic input to generate, propagate, and time action potentials.},

	abstract = {Sensory inputs frequently converge on the brain in a spatially organized manner, often with overlapping inputs to multiple target neurons. Whether the responses of target neurons with common inputs become decorrelated depends on the contribution of local circuit interactions. We addressed this issue in the olfactory system using newly generated transgenic mice that express channelrhodopsin-2 in all of the olfactory sensory neurons. By selectively stimulating individual glomeruli with light, we identified mitral/tufted cells that receive common input (sister cells). Sister cells had highly correlated responses to odors, as measured by average spike rates, but their spike timing in relation to respiration was differentially altered. In contrast, non-sister cells correlated poorly on both of these measures. We suggest that sister mitral/tufted cells carry two different channels of information: average activity representing shared glomerular input and phase-specific information that refines odor representations and is substantially independent for sister cells.},

	abstract = {Adult-born neurons ({ABNs)} are added to the olfactory bulb ({OB)} throughout life in rodents. While many factors have been identified as regulating the survival and integration of {ABNs} into existing circuitry, the understanding of how these factors affect {ABN} morphology and connectivity is limited. Here we compare how cell intrinsic [small interfering {RNA} ({siRNA)} knock-down of voltage gated sodium channels Na(V)1.1-1.3] and circuit level (naris occlusion) reductions in activity affect {ABN} morphology during integration into the {OB.} We found that both manipulations reduce the number of dendritic spines (and thus likely the number of reciprocal synaptic connections) formed with the surrounding circuitry and inhibited dendritic ramification of {ABNs.} Further, we identified regions of {ABN} apical dendrites where the largest and most significant decreases occur following {siRNA} knock-down or naris occlusion. In {siRNA} knock-down cells, reduction of spines is observed in proximal regions of the apical dendrite. This suggests that distal regions of the dendrite may remain active independent of Na(V)1.1-1.3 channel expression, perhaps facilitated by activation of T-type calcium channels and {NMDA} receptors. By contrast, circuit level reduction of activity by naris occlusion resulted in a global depression of spine number. Together, these results indicate that {ABNs} retain the ability to develop their typical overall morphological features regardless of experienced activity, and activity modulates the number and location of formed connections.},

Due to the formidable heterogeneity of intermixed cell types that make up the brain, isolating cell types prior to microarray processing poses steep technical challenges that have been met in various ways. These methodological differences have the potential to distort cell-type-specific gene expression profiles insofar as they may insufficiently filter out contaminating {mRNAs} or induce aberrant cellular responses not normally present in vivo. Thus we have compared the repeatability, susceptibility to contamination from off-target cell-types, and evidence for stress-responsive gene expression of five different purification methods - Laser Capture Microdissection ({LCM)}, Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification ({TRAP)}, Immunopanning ({PAN)}, Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting ({FACS)}, and manual sorting of fluorescently labeled cells (Manual). We found that all methods obtained comparably high levels of repeatability, however, data from {LCM} and {TRAP} showed significantly higher levels of contamination than the other methods. While {PAN} samples showed higher activation of apoptosis-related, stress-related and immediate early genes, samples from {FACS} and Manual studies, which also require dissociated cells, did not. Given that {TRAP} targets actively translated {mRNAs}, whereas other methods target all transcribed {mRNAs}, observed differences may also reflect translational regulation.},

To understand this result, we applied a framework for quantifying statistical relationships between neurons (Schneidman et al., 2003) to all possible combinations of neurons within our ensembles. We found that almost all neurons (96\%) contributed redundant predictive information to the ensembles. This redundancy resulted in the maintenance of predictive information despite the removal of many neurons from each ensemble. Moreover, the balance of synergistic and redundant interactions depended on the number of neurons in the ensemble. Small ensembles could exhibit synergistic interactions (e.g., 23 +/- 9\% of ensembles with two neurons were synergistic). In contrast, larger ensembles exhibited mostly redundant interactions (e.g., 99 +/- 0.1\% of ensembles with eight neurons were redundant). We discuss these results with regard to constraints on interpreting neuronal ensemble data and with respect to motor cortex involvement in reaction time performance.},

Recent research on retinal function has substantially advanced understanding in both areas. First, visual information is transmitted to the brain by at least 17 distinct retinal ganglion cell types defined by characteristic morphology, light response properties, and central projections. These findings provide a much more accurate view of the parallel visual pathways emanating from the retina than do previous models, and they highlight the importance of identifying distinct cell types and their connectivity in other neural circuits. Second, encoding of visual information involves significant temporal structure and interactions in the spike trains of retinal neurons. The functional importance of this structure is revealed by computational analysis of encoding and decoding, an approach that may be applicable to understanding the function of other neural circuits.},

Horizontal cells sample from these cones, and other cones outside of the {RGCs} center, these other cones from the "surround". Horizontal cells deliver effective inhibition to the center cones or bipolar cells, forming the inhibitory surround. You can think of the biploar/horizontal circuit as doing a simple addition/subtraction across the total {RF} like local gain control.
This is only part of the picture though because there's many other types of {RGCs}, specifically the parasol {RGCs} which do not have center-surround receptive fields. Also not all {RGC} subtypes go to the primary visual pathway (ie to the {LGN)}, some go to areas like superior colliculus or suprachiasmatic nucleus, which don't have sophisticated processing elements (like {LGN} or V1).
In summary, it's not the case that all {RGCs} display center-surround, classical lateral inhibtion, receptive fields.}

We developed a behavioral paradigm for mice in which both the duration of odorant sampling and the difficulty of the odor discrimination task were controlled by the experimenter. We observed that the accuracy of odor discrimination increases with the duration of imposed odorant sampling, and that the rate of this increase is slower for harder tasks. We also present a unifying picture of two previous, seemingly disparate experiments on timing of odorant sampling in odor discrimination tasks. The presence of {SAT} in olfaction provides strong evidence for temporal integration in olfaction and puts a constraint on models of olfactory processing.},

Although many channel proteins conducting these currents are phylogenetically conserved, channels of the same type in different animals can have different voltage dependencies and dynamics. What does this mean for our ability to derive rules about the role of different types of ion channels in neuronal activity? Can results about the role of a particular channel type in a particular type of neuron be generalized to other neuron types? We compare spiking model neurons in two databases constructed by exploring the maximal conductance spaces of two models. The first is a model of crustacean stomatogastric neurons, and the second is a model of rodent thalamocortical neurons, but both models contain similar types of membrane currents. Spiking neurons in both databases show distinct fast and slow subpopulations, but our analysis reveals that related currents play different roles in fast and slow spiking in the stomatogastric versus thalamocortical neurons. This analysis involved conductance-space visualization and comparison of voltage traces, current traces, and frequency-current relationships from all spiker subpopulations. Our results are consistent with previous work indicating that the role a membrane current plays in shaping a neuron's behavior depends on the voltage dependence and dynamics of that current and may be different in different neuron types depending on the properties of other currents it is interacting with. Conclusions about the function of a type of membrane current based on experiments or simulations in one type of neuron may therefore not generalize to other neuron types.},

The results showed that {PVN} pre-autonomic neurones constitute a heterogeneous neuronal population. Based on morphological criteria, neurones were classified into three subgroups. Type A neurones (52 \%) were located in the ventral parvocellular ({PaV)} subnucleus, and showed an oblique orientation with respect to the third ventricle ({3V).} Type B neurones (25 \%) were located in the posterior parvocellular ({PaPo)} subnucleus, and were oriented perpendicularly with respect to the {3V.} Type C neurones (23 \%) were located in both the {PaPo} (82 \%) and the {PaV} (18 \%) subnuclei, and displayed a concentric dendritic configuration. A morphometric analysis revealed significant differences in the dendritic configuration among neuronal types. Type B neurones had the most complex dendritic arborization, with longer and more branching dendritic trees. Several electrophysiological properties, including cell input resistance and action potential waveforms, differed between cell types, suggesting that the expression and/or properties of a variety of ion channels differ between neuronal types. Common features of {PVN} pre-autonomic neurones included the expression of a low-threshold spike and strong inward rectification. These properties distinguished them from neighbouring magnocellular vasopressin neurones. In summary, these results indicate that {PVN} pre-autonomic neurones constitute a heterogeneous neuronal population, and provide a cellular basis for the study of their involvement in the pathophysiology of hypertension and congestive heart failure disorders.},

	abstract = {In the auditory system, the stimulus-response properties of single neurons are often described in terms of the spectrotemporal receptive field ({STRF)}, a linear kernel relating the spectrogram of the sound stimulus to the instantaneous firing rate of the neuron. Several algorithms have been used to estimate {STRFs} from responses to natural stimuli; these algorithms differ in their functional models, cost functions, and regularization methods. Here, we characterize the stimulus-response function of auditory neurons using a generalized linear model ({GLM).} In this model, each cell's input is described by: 1) a stimulus filter ({STRF);} and 2) a post-spike filter, which captures dependencies on the neuron's spiking history. The output of the model is given by a series of spike trains rather than instantaneous firing rate, allowing the prediction of spike train responses to novel stimuli. We fit the model by maximum penalized likelihood to the spiking activity of zebra finch auditory midbrain neurons in response to conspecific vocalizations (songs) and modulation limited (ml) noise. We compare this model to normalized reverse correlation ({NRC)}, the traditional method for {STRF} estimation, in terms of predictive power and the basic tuning properties of the estimated {STRFs.} We find that a {GLM} with a sparse prior predicts novel responses to both stimulus classes significantly better than {NRC.} Importantly, we find that {STRFs} from the two models derived from the same responses can differ substantially and that {GLM} {STRFs} are more consistent between stimulus classes than {NRC} {STRFs.} These results suggest that a {GLM} with a sparse prior provides a more accurate characterization of spectrotemporal tuning than does the {NRC} method when responses to complex sounds are studied in these neurons.},

Recent work shows that many central synapses are surprisingly unreliable at signaling the arrival of single presynaptic action potentials to the postsynaptic neuron. However, bursts are reliably signaled because transmitter release is facilitated. Thus, these synapses can be viewed as filters that transmit bursts, but filter out single spikes. Bursts appear to have a special role in synaptic plasticity and information processing. In the hippocampus, a single burst can produce long-term synaptic modifications. In brain structures whose computational role is known, action potentials that arrive in bursts provide more-precise information than action potentials that arrive singly. These results, and the requirement for multiple inputs to fire a cell suggest that the best stimulus for exciting a cell (that is, a neural code) is coincident bursts.},

Cortical receptive fields represent the signal preferences of sensory neurons. Receptive fields are thought to provide a representation of sensory experience from which the cerebral cortex may make interpretations. While it is essential to determine a neuron's receptive field, it remains unclear which features of the acoustic environment are specifically represented by neurons in the primary auditory cortex ({AI).} We characterized cat {AI} spectrotemporal receptive fields ({STRFs)} by finding both the spike-triggered average ({STA)} and stimulus dimensions that maximized the mutual information between response and stimulus. We derived a nonlinearity relating spiking to stimulus projection onto two maximally informative dimensions ({MIDs).} The {STA} was highly correlated with the first {MID.} Generally, the nonlinearity for the first {MID} was asymmetric and often monotonic in shape, while the second {MID} nonlinearity was symmetric and nonmonotonic. The joint nonlinearity for both {MIDs} revealed that most first and second {MIDs} were synergistic and thus should be considered conjointly. The difference between the nonlinearities suggests different possible roles for the {MIDs} in auditory processing.},

All previously published claims for genetic influences of this kind now appear to have been false positives. For more serious psychiatric and medical disorders such as schizophrenia and autism, several genes have been found where a rare mutation contributes to abnormal behavior, but in many instances they are de novo mutations not obtained from a parent. Despite the many disappointments in the search for genes influencing human behavior, the field of molecular genetics has made remarkable progress to the extent that several broadly applicable principles can now be affirmed. These principles show how development is regulated by networks of interacting genes that function in an environmental context. They invalidate several key assumptions of statistical genetic analysis that are made when estimating heritability. There is now a need to reform the teaching of genetics to our students and to restrict the funding of further searches for elusive genes that account for so little variance in normal behaviors.},

To probe synaptic connectivity in the {OB}, we injected a retrograde-specific strain of the pseudorabies virus into the rat {OB} and piriform cortex. The viral-staining patterns revealed a striking columnar organization that extended across all layers of the {OB} from the glomeruli to the deep granule cell layer. We hypothesize that the columns represent an extension of the glomerular unit. Specific patterning was observed, suggesting selective, rather than distance-dependent, center-surround connectivity. The results provide a previously undescribed basis for interpreting the synaptic connections between mitral and granule cells within the context of a columnar organization in the {OB} and have implications for olfactory coding and network organization.},

	abstract = {Neurons in the prefrontal cortex exhibit diverse behavioural correlates, an observation that has been attributed to cell-type diversity. To link identified neuron types with network and behavioural functions, we recorded from the two largest genetically defined inhibitory interneuron classes, the perisomatically targeting parvalbumin ({PV)} and the dendritically targeting somatostatin ({SOM)} neurons in anterior cingulate cortex of mice performing a reward foraging task. Here we show that {PV} and a subtype of {SOM} neurons form functionally homogeneous populations showing a double dissociation between both their inhibitory effects and behavioural correlates. Out of several events pertaining to behaviour, a subtype of {SOM} neurons selectively responded at reward approach, whereas {PV} neurons responded at reward leaving and encoded preceding stay duration. These behavioural correlates of {PV} and {SOM} neurons defined a behavioural epoch and a decision variable important for foraging (whether to stay or to leave), a crucial function attributed to the anterior cingulate cortex. Furthermore, {PV} neurons could fire in millisecond synchrony, exerting fast and powerful inhibition on principal cell firing, whereas the inhibitory effect of {SOM} neurons on firing output was weak and more variable, consistent with the idea that they respectively control the outputs of, and inputs to, principal neurons. These results suggest a connection between the circuit-level function of different interneuron types in regulating the flow of information and the behavioural functions served by the cortical circuits. Moreover, these observations bolster the hope that functional response diversity during behaviour can in part be explained by cell-type diversity.},

We found that patterns of spikes and silence across a population of nominally redundant neurons can carry up to twice as much information about visual motion than does population spike count, even when the neurons respond independently to their sensory inputs. This extra information arises by virtue of the broad diversity of firing rate dynamics found in even very similarly tuned groups of {MT} neurons. Additionally, specific patterns of spiking and silence can carry more information than the sum of their parts (synergy), opening up the possibility for combinatorial coding in cortex. These results also held for populations in which we imposed levels of nonindependence (correlation) comparable to those found in cortical recordings. Our findings suggest that combinatorial codes are advantageous for representing stimulus information on short time scales, even when neurons have no complicated, stimulus-dependent correlation structure.},

Given the improvement in motor performance with practice and the ability of the spinal cord circuitry to learn to step more effectively when the mode of training allows variability, we examined why this intrinsic variability is an important factor. Intramuscular {EMG} electrodes were implanted to monitor and compare the patterns of activation of flexor (tibialis anterior) and extensor (soleus) muscles associated with a fixed-trajectory and assist-as-needed ({AAN)} step training paradigms in rats after a complete midthoracic (T8-T9) spinal cord transection. Both methods involved a robotic arm attached to each ankle of the rat to provide guidance during stepping. The fixed trajectory allowed little variance between steps, and the {AAN} provided guidance only when the ankle deviated a specified distance from the programmed trajectory. We hypothesized that an {AAN} paradigm would impose fewer disruptions of the control strategies intrinsic to the spinal locomotor circuitry compared with a fixed trajectory. Intrathecal injections of quipazine were given to each rat to facilitate stepping. Analysis confirmed that there were more corrections within a fixed-trajectory step cycle and consequently there was less coactivation of agonist and antagonist muscles during the {AAN} paradigm. These data suggest that some critical level of variation in the specific circuitry activated and the resulting kinematics reflect a fundamental feature of the neural control mechanisms even in a highly repetitive motor task.},

	abstract = {Decoding visual information from a population of retinal ganglion cells. J. Neurophysiol. 78: 2336-2350, 1997. This work investigates how a time-dependent visual stimulus is encoded by the collective activity of many retinal ganglion cells. Multiple ganglion cell spike trains were recorded simultaneously from the isolated retina of the tiger salamander using a multielectrode array. The stimulus consisted of photopic, spatially uniform, temporally broadband flicker. From the recorded spike trains, an estimate was obtained of the stimulus intensity as a function of time. This was compared with the actual stimulus to assess the quality and quantity of visual information conveyed by the ganglion cell population. Two algorithms were used to decode the spike trains: an optimized linear filter in which each action potential made an additive contribution to the stimulus estimate and an artificial neural network trained by back-propagation to match spike trains with stimuli. The two methods performed indistinguishably, suggesting that most of the information about this stimulus can be extracted by linear operations on the spike trains. Individual ganglion cells conveyed information at a rate of 3.2 +/- 1.7 bits/s (mean +/- {SD)}, with an average information content per spike of 1.6 bits. The maximal possible rate of information transmission compatible with the measured spiking statistics was 13.9 +/- 6.3 bits/s. On average, ganglion cells used 22\% of this capacity to encode visual information. When a decoder received two spike trains of the same response type, the reconstruction improved only marginally over that obtained from a single cell. However, a decoder using an and an cell extracted as much information as the sum of that obtained from each cell alone. Thus cells of opposite response type encode different and nonoverlapping features of the stimulus. As more spike trains were provided to the decoder, the total information rate rapidly saturated, with 79\% of the maximal value obtained from a local cluster of just four neurons of different functional types. The decoding filter applied to a given neuron's spikes within such a multiunit decoder differed substantially from the filter applied to that same neuron in a single-unit decoder. This shows that the optimal interpretation of a ganglion cell's action potential depends strongly on the simultaneous activity of other nearby cells. The quality of the stimulus reconstruction varied greatly with frequency: flicker components below 1 Hz and above 10 Hz were reconstructed poorly, and the performance was optimal near 2.5 Hz. Further analysis suggests that temporal encoding by ganglion cell spike trains is limited by slow phototransduction in the cone photoreceptors and a corrupting noise source proximal to the cones.},

	abstract = {There are at least three possibilities for encoding information in a small area of cortex. First, neurons could have identical characteristics, thus conveying redundant information; second, neurons could give different responses to the same stimuli, thus conveying independent information; or third, neurons could cooperate with each other to encode more information jointly than they do separately, that is, synergistically. We recorded from 28 pairs of neurons in inferior temporal cortex of behaving rhesus monkeys. Each pair was recorded from a single microelectrode. Both the magnitude and the temporal modulation of the responses were quantified. We separated the responses into signal (average response to each stimulus) and noise (deviation of each response from the average). Linear regression showed that an average of only 18.7\% of the magnitude of the signal carried by one neuron could be predicted from the magnitude of the other, and only 22.0\% could be predicted by including the temporal modulation. For the noise, the figures were 5.5\% and 6.3\%, respectively, even less than for the signal. Information theoretic analysis shows that the pairs of neurons we studied carried an average of 20\% redundant information. However, even this relatively small amount of redundancy places a severe upper limit on the information that can be transmitted by a neuronal pool. A pool of neurons for which each pair is mutually redundant to extent y can only carry a maximum of 1/y, here five times, as much information as one neuron alone. Information theoretic analysis gave no evidence for the presence of information as a function of both neurons considered together, that is, synergistic codes. Cross-correlation showed that at least 61\% of the neuronal pairs shared connections in some manner. Given these shared connections, if adjacent neurons had had identical characteristics, then the noise on the outputs of these neurons would have been highly correlated, and it would not be possible to separate the signal and noise. The severe impact of correlated noise and information redundancy leads us to propose that the processing carried out by these neurons evolved both to provide a rich description of many stimulus properties and simultaneously to minimize the redundancy in a local group of neurons. These two principles appear to be a major constraint on the organization of inferior temporal, and possibly all, cortex.},

First, how the neurons comprising the circuit are connected, and second, how neurons and their connections change after learning or in response to neuromodulators. Neuronal connectivity is difficult to determine experimentally, whereas neuronal activity can often be readily measured. We describe a statistical model to estimate circuit connectivity directly from measured activity patterns. We use the timing relationships between observed spikes to predict synaptic interactions between simultaneously observed neurons. The model estimate provides each predicted connection with a curve that represents how strongly, and at which temporal delays, one circuit element effectively influences another. These curves are analogous to synaptic interactions of the level of the membrane potential of biological neurons and share some of their features such as being inhibitory or excitatory. We test our method on recordings from the pyloric circuit in the crab stomatogastric ganglion, a small circuit whose connectivity is completely known beforehand, and find that the predicted circuit matches the biological one — a result other techniques failed to achieve. In addition, we show that drug manipulations impacting the circuit are revealed by this technique. These results illustrate the utility of our analysis approach for inferring connections from neural spiking activity.},

However, activating the {AL} directly with simple pulses of current evoked responses in {AL} neurons that were much less diverse, complex, and enduring than responses elicited by odorants. Similarly, models of the {AL} driven by simplistic inputs generated relatively simple output. How then are dynamic neural codes for odors generated? Consistent with recent results from several other species, our recordings from locust {ORNs} showed a great diversity of temporal structure. Furthermore, we found that, viewed as a population, many response features of {ORNs} were remarkably similar to those observed within the {AL.} Using a set of computational models constrained by our electrophysiological recordings, we found that the temporal heterogeneity of responses of {ORNs} critically underlies the generation of spatiotemporal odor codes in the {AL.} A test then performed in vivo confirmed that, given temporally homogeneous input, the {AL} cannot create diverse spatiotemporal patterns on its own; however, given temporally heterogeneous input, the {AL} generated realistic firing patterns. Finally, given the temporally structured input provided by {ORNs}, we clarified several separate, additional contributions of the {AL} to olfactory information processing. Thus, our results demonstrate the origin and subsequent reformatting of spatiotemporal neural codes for odors.},

	abstract = {Uncertainty coming from the noise in its neurons and the ill-posed nature of many tasks plagues neural computations. Maybe surprisingly, many studies show that the brain manipulates these forms of uncertainty in a probabilistically consistent and normative manner, and there is now a rich theoretical literature on the capabilities of populations of neurons to implement computations in the face of uncertainty. However, one major facet of uncertainty has received comparatively little attention: time. In a dynamic, rapidly changing world, data are only temporarily relevant. Here, we analyze the computational consequences of encoding stimulus trajectories in populations of neurons. For the most obvious, simple, instantaneous encoder, the correlations induced by natural, smooth stimuli engender a decoder that requires access to information that is nonlocal both in time and across neurons. This formally amounts to a ruinous representation. We show that there is an alternative encoder that is computationally and representationally powerful in which each spike contributes independent information; it is independently decodable, in other words. We suggest this as an appropriate foundation for understanding time-varying population codes. Furthermore, we show how adaptation to temporal stimulus statistics emerges directly from the demands of simple decoding.},

	abstract = {An immunocytochemical analysis with 33 antisera was undertaken to investigate the localization of 25 different neurotransmitter-related antigens in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus in the rat. To obtain estimates of relative densities of immunoreactive axons a stereological approach was used involving counting of intersections of immunoreactive axons with a superimposed semi-circle test grid.

All neurotransmitter-related antigens found in perikarya within the suprachiasmatic nucleus, including those stained with antisera against bombesin, gastrin-releasing peptide, neurophysin, vasopressin, somatostatin, γ-aminobutyrate, glutamate decarboxylase and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide were also found in axons within the nucleus. A greater number of these immunoreactive axons was found within the nucleus than in the adjacent anterior hypothalamus. The size of all immunoreactive axons in the suprachiasmatic nucleus was consistently small; immunoreactive axons were found ramifying widely in the nucleus, often ending with terminal boutons near perikarya immunoreactive for the same antigen. All neurotransmitter-related substances found in perikarya of the suprachiasmatic nucleus were also found in axons crossing over the midline to innervate the contralateral nucleus, providing an anatomical substrate for a high degree of communication between the paired nuclei. Axons immunoreactive for other putative transmitters including serotonin arising outside the nucleus were also found in high densities within the nucleus and crossing over the midline between the nuclei. Immunoreactivity for some transmitters was found in axons of similar densities within and outside the nucleus, including antisera against tyrosine hydroxylase; a small number of dopamine β-hydroxylase and a few phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase-immunoreactive axons were found in the {SCN}, suggesting that dopamine, norepinephrine and epinephrine may occur in a limited number of axons in the nucleus.

Small numbers of axons immunoreactive with antisera raised against cholecystokinin, prolactin, substance P, thyrotropin-releasing hormone and choline acetyltransferase were found within the suprachiasmatic nucleus. Axons immunoreactive for luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone, adrenocorticotropic hormone, α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone and neurotensin were rarely found within the suprachiasmatic nucleus; axons immunoreactive for luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone, adreno-corticotropic hormone, cholecystokinin and tyrosine hydroxylase were found in both horizontal and coronal sections in the area between the left and right suprachiasmatic nuclei. Tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive cell bodies were situated in the same midline area, as well as at the lateral and dorsal borders of the suprachiasmatic nuclei. Although axons immunoreactive for any one substance were not found exclusively in any one area of the nucleus, regional differences in axon density were found; bombesin- and gastrin-releasing peptide-immunoreactive axons, for instance, were more frequent in the ventral suprachiasmatic nucleus near immunoreactive perikarya, while vasopressin-neurophysin immunoreactivity appeared greater in the dorsomedial part of the nucleus. Efferent projections from the nucleus to hypothalamic and extrahypothalamic areas are discussed and the probable cross-reaction of different antisera with a single antigen is considered.

The finding of many different putative neurotransmitters within the suprachiasmatic nucleus serves to underscore the complex axonal organization of the nucleus.},

Improvements in audio-vocal coupling that heighten the detection of conspecifics are part of the reproductive strategy of many nonmammalian vertebrates [6,7]. Although seasonal changes in hearing are known [7,8,9,10,11], molecular mechanisms determining this form of adult sensory plasticity remain elusive. Among both nonmammals [12] and mammals [13,14], large-conductance, calcium-activated potassium ({BK)} channels underlie a primary outward current having a predominant influence on frequency tuning in auditory hair cells [12]. We now report an example from fish showing that increased {BK} channel abundance can improve an individual’s ability to hear vocalizations during the breeding season. Pharmacological manipulations targeting {BK} channels, together with measures of {BK} transcript abundance, can explain the seasonal enhancement of auditory hair cell sensitivity to the frequency content of calls. Plasticity in ion channel expression is a simple, evolutionarily labile solution for sculpting sensory bandwidth to maximize the detection of conspecific signals during reproductive cycles.},

	abstract = {Neurons, or nerve cells in the brain, communicate with each other using stereotyped electric pulses, called spikes. It is believed that neurons convey information mainly through the frequency of the transmitted spikes, called the firing rate. In addition, neurons may communicate some information through the finer temporal patterns of the spikes. Neuronal firing patterns may depend on cellular organization, which varies among the regions of the brain, according to the roles they play, such as sensation, association, and motion. In order to examine the relationship among signals, structure, and function, we devised a metric to detect firing irregularity intrinsic and specific to individual neurons and analyzed spike sequences from over 1,000 neurons in 15 different cortical areas. Here we report two results of this study. First, we found that neurons exhibit stable firing patterns that can be characterized as “regular”, “random”, and “bursty”. Second, we observed a strong correlation between the type of signaling pattern exhibited by neurons in a given area and the function of that area. This suggests that, in addition to reflecting the cellular organization of the brain, neuronal signaling patterns may also play a role in specific types of neuronal computations.},

Various authors have proposed alternative classification schemes that rely on the concomitant observation of several multimodal features. However, a broad variability is generally observed even among cells that are grouped into a same class. Furthermore, the attribution of specific neurons to a single defined class is often difficult, because individual properties vary in a highly graded fashion, suggestive of continua of features between types. Going beyond the description of representative traits of distinct classes, we focus here on the analysis of atypical cells. We introduce a novel paradigm for neuronal type classification, assuming explicitly the existence of a structured continuum of diversity. Our approach, grounded on the theory of fuzzy sets, identifies a small optimal number of model archetypes. At the same time, it quantifies the degree of similarity between these archetypes and each considered neuron. This allows highlighting archetypal cells, which bear a clear similarity to a single model archetype, and edge cells, which manifest a convergence of traits from multiple archetypes.},

Although this seemingly simple question has helped us shed light on the neural code, we still do not understand the anatomical and neurophysiological constraints that enable these codes to propagate across synapses and form the basis for computations that we need to interact with our environment. The sensitivity of neuronal activity to the timing of synaptic inputs naturally suggests that synchrony determines the form of the neural code, and, in turn, regulation of synchrony is a critical element in 'writing' the neural code through the artificial control of microcircuits to activate downstream structures. In this way, reading and writing the neural code are inextricably linked.},

We focus on phenomenological synaptic models that are compatible with integrate-and-fire type neuron models where each neuron is described by a small number of variables. This implies that synaptic update rules for short-term or long-term plasticity can only depend on spike timing and, potentially, on membrane potential, as well as on the value of the synaptic weight, or on low-pass filtered (temporally averaged) versions of the above variables. We examine the ability of the models to account for experimental data and to fulfill expectations derived from theoretical considerations. We further discuss their relations to teacher-based rules (supervised learning) and reward-based rules (reinforcement learning).

	abstract = {Sniffing is a specialized respiratory behavior that is essential for the acquisition of odors [1,2,3,4]. Perhaps not independent of this, sniffing is commonly displayed during motivated [5,6,7] and social behaviors [8,9]. No measures of sniffing among interacting animals are available, however, calling into question the utility of this behavior in the social context. From radiotelemetry recordings of nasal respiration, I found that investigation by one rat toward the facial region of a conspecific often elicits a decrease in sniffing frequency in the conspecific. This reciprocal display of sniffing was found to be dependent upon the rat’s social status in two separate paradigms, with subordinates reliably decreasing their sniffing frequency upon being investigated in the face by dominant rats. Failure of subordinates to decrease their sniffing frequency shortened the latency for agonistic behavior by dominant rats, reflecting that decreases in sniffing serve as appeasement signals during social interactions. Rats rendered unable to smell persisted in displaying reciprocal sniffing behavior, demonstrating the independence of this behavior from olfaction. Oxytocin treatment in rats with established social hierarchies abolished agonistic behaviors and reciprocal sniffing displays. Together, these findings demonstrate that rodents utilize sniffing behaviors communicatively, not only to collect [6,10,11,12,13,14] but also to convey information.},

Understanding the structure and function of population neural codes is challenging because of the exponential number of possible activity patterns and dependencies among neurons. We report here that for groups of {\textasciitilde}100 retinal neurons responding to natural stimuli, pairwise-based models, which were highly accurate for small networks, are no longer sufficient. We show that because of the sparse nature of the neural code, the higher-order interactions can be easily learned using a novel model and that a very sparse low-order interaction network underlies the code of large populations of neurons. Additionally, we show that the interaction network is organized in a hierarchical and modular manner, which hints at scalability. Our results suggest that learnability may be a key feature of the neural code.},

Here we provide evidence that the auditory system summarizes the temporal details of sounds using time-averaged statistics. We measured discrimination of 'sound textures' that were characterized by particular statistical properties, as normally result from the superposition of many acoustic features in auditory scenes. When listeners discriminated examples of different textures, performance improved with excerpt duration. In contrast, when listeners discriminated different examples of the same texture, performance declined with duration, a paradoxical result given that the information available for discrimination grows with duration. These results indicate that once these sounds are of moderate length, the brain's representation is limited to time-averaged statistics, which, for different examples of the same texture, converge to the same values with increasing duration. Such statistical representations produce good categorical discrimination, but limit the ability to discern temporal detail.},

(1) Fast-spiking ({FS)} cells (35\% of the total sample) showed an abrupt episode of nonadapting repetitive discharges of shorter-duration action potentials. {FS} cells had local and horizontal axonal arbors which did not enter layer I. This type of {FS} cell was immunoreactive for parvalbumin and included some basket cells. Three chandelier cells were identified as {FS} cells, although one chandelier cell was not identified as an {FS} cell. (2) Late- spiking ({LS)} cells (11\%) exhibited slowly developing ramp depolarizations near threshold. {LS} cells were neurogliaform cells. (3) Low-threshold spike ({LTS)} cells (5\%) had prominent low-threshold spikes when stimulated from hyperpolarizations. The main axons of {LTS} cells ascended, and the collaterals entered into layer I. (4) The remaining cells [regular-spiking nonpyramidal ({RSNP)} cells] (49\%) could not be categorized into the above three subgroups. In some {RSNP} cells depolarizing pulses from hyperpolarizations induced fast depolarizing notches with small amplitude. {RSNP} cells had vertically elongated axonal fields, extending from layer I to V, sometimes to layer {VI.} This subgroup included double bouquet cells and bipolar cells. Each subgroup with a different firing mode may differentially contribute to neocortical laminar and columnar circuitry.},

We found that extracellular fields induced ephaptically mediated changes in the somatic membrane potential that were less than 0.5 {mV} under subthreshold conditions. Despite their small size, these fields could strongly entrain action potentials, particularly for slow ({\textless}8 Hz) fluctuations of the extracellular field.

Brain Explorer also allows viewing of the original {ISH} images referenced from any point in a {3D} data set. Anatomic and spatial homology searches can be performed from the application to find data sets with expression in specific structures and with similar expression patterns.

Here we investigated the relationship between {CRF} neuronal organization and visual pathways in toads. {CRF-immunoreactive} (ir) neurons and fibers were widely distributed throughout the ventral subpallial telencephalon and hypothalamus, although few fibers were found in telencephalic areas, such as the striatum, that are known to project to the tectum in anurans. Large populations of {CRF-ir} cells were observed in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and preoptic area as well as in the ventral infundibular hypothalamus. {CRF-ir} neurons and fibers also were observed in several midbrain and brain stem areas. Colchicine treatment significantly enhanced {CRF-ir} neurons and fibers throughout the brain, and revealed {CRF-ir} cell groups in several brain areas (including the dorsal hypothalamus) that were not observed in untreated animals. Intrinsic {CRF-immunoreactive} neurons were routinely observed in cell layer 8 and sometimes in layer 6 of the optic tectum in both untreated and colchicine-treated animals. {CRF} was detected in toad optic tectum by radioimmunoassay, although tectal {CRF} content was less than that of the hypothalamus and forebrain. Unilateral eye ablation did not affect {CRF} content of the contralateral optic tectum. We conclude that {CRF-producing} neurons are widely distributed in several areas of the toad brain known to be involved in regulating the behavioral, autonomic and endocrine response to stressors, including the optic tectum and several brain areas known to project to the optic tectum. Furthermore, retinal afferents do not contribute significantly to tectal {CRF} content.},

We found that speed of discrimination was independent of odor similarity, as measured by overlap of glomerular activity patterns. Even when pushed to psychophysical limits using mixtures of two odors, rats needed to take only one sniff ({\textless}200 ms at theta frequency) to make a decision of maximum accuracy.

We analysed the neural activity recorded in monkeys during an object sequence memory task to identify a role of mixed selectivity in subserving the cognitive functions ascribed to the {PFC.} We show that mixed selectivity neurons encode distributed information about all task-relevant aspects. Each aspect can be decoded from the population of neurons even when single-cell selectivity to that aspect is eliminated. Moreover, mixed selectivity offers a significant computational advantage over specialized responses in terms of the repertoire of input–output functions implementable by readout neurons. This advantage originates from the highly diverse nonlinear selectivity to mixtures of task-relevant variables, a signature of high-dimensional neural representations. Crucially, this dimensionality is predictive of animal behaviour as it collapses in error trials. Our findings recommend a shift of focus for future studies from neurons that have easily interpretable response tuning to the widely observed, but rarely analysed, mixed selectivity neurons.},

In many species, sensory stimuli elicit the oscillatory synchronization of groups of neurons. What determines the properties of these oscillations? In the olfactory system of the moth, we found that odors elicited oscillatory synchronization through a neural mechanism like that described in locust and Drosophila. During responses to long odor pulses, oscillations suddenly slowed as net olfactory receptor neuron ({ORN)} output decreased; thus, stimulus intensity appeared to determine oscillation frequency. However, changing the concentration of the odor had little effect upon oscillatory frequency. Our recordings in vivo and computational models based on these results suggested that the main effect of increasing odor concentration was to recruit additional, less well-tuned {ORNs} whose firing rates were tightly constrained by adaptation and saturation. Thus, in the periphery, concentration is encoded mainly by the size of the responsive {ORN} population, and oscillation frequency is set by the adaptation and saturation of this response.},

	volume = {91},
	issn = {0306-4522},
	abstract = {We used whole-cell patch recording to study 102 local interneurons in the rat dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus in vitro. Input impedance with this technique (607.0+/-222.4 {MOhm)} was far larger than that measured with sharp electrode techniques, suggesting that interneurons may be more electrotonically compact than previously believed. Consistent and robust burst firing was observed in all interneurons when a slight depolarizing boost was given from a potential at, or slightly hyperpolarized from, resting membrane potential. These bursts had some similarities to the low-threshold spike described previously in other thalamic neuron types. The bursting responses were blocked by Ni+, suggesting that the low-threshold calcium current I(T), responsible for the low-threshold spike, was also involved in interneuron burst firing. Compared to the low-threshold spike of thalamocortical cells, however, the interneuron bursts were of relatively long duration and low intraburst frequency. The requirement for a depolarizing boost to elicit the burst is consistent with previous reports of a depolarizing shift of the I(T) activation curve of interneurons relative to thalamocortical cells, a finding we confirmed using voltage-clamp. Voltage-clamp study also revealed an additional long-lasting current that could be tentatively identified as the calcium activated non-selective cation current, I({CAN)}, based on reversal potential and on pharmacological characteristics. Computer simulation of the interneuron burst demonstrated that its particular morphology is likely due to the interaction of I(T) and I({CAN).} In the slice, bursts could also be elicited by stimulation of the optic tract, suggesting that they may occur in response to natural stimulation. Synaptically triggered bursts were only partially blocked by Ni+, but could then be completely blocked by further addition of (+/-)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid. The existence of robust bursts in this cell type suggests an additional role for interneurons in sculpting sensory responses by feedforward inhibition of thalamocortical cells. The low-threshold spike is a mechanism whereby activity in a neuron is dependent on a prior lack of activity in that same neuron. Understanding of the low-threshold spike in the other major neuron types of the thalamus has brought many new insights into how thalamic oscillations might be involved in sleep and epilepsy. Our description of this phenomenon in the interneurons of the thalamus suggests that these network oscillations might be even more complicated than previously believed.},

	abstract = {Abstract  The dynamic {I–V} curve method was recently introduced for the efficient experimental generation of reduced neuron models. The method extracts
the response properties of a neuron while it is subject to a naturalistic stimulus that mimics in vivo-like fluctuating synaptic
drive. The resulting history-dependent, transmembrane current is then projected onto a one-dimensional current–voltage relation
that provides the basis for a tractable non-linear integrate-and-fire model. An attractive feature of the method is that it
can be used in spike-triggered mode to quantify the distinct patterns of post-spike refractoriness seen in different classes
of cortical neuron. The method is first illustrated using a conductance-based model and is then applied experimentally to
generate reduced models of cortical layer-5 pyramidal cells and interneurons, in injected-current and injected- conductance
protocols. The resulting low-dimensional neuron models—of the refractory exponential integrate-and-fire type—provide highly
accurate predictions for spike-times. The method therefore provides a useful tool for the construction of tractable models
and rapid experimental classification of cortical neurons.},

Brain-computer interfaces ({BCIs)} may one day assist patients suffering from neurological injury or disease, but relatively low system performance remains a major obstacle. In fact, the speed and accuracy with which keys can be selected using {BCIs} is still far lower than for systems relying on eye movements. This is true whether {BCIs} use recordings from populations of individual neurons using invasive electrode techniques or electroencephalogram recordings using less- or non-invasive techniques. Here we present the design and demonstration, using electrode arrays implanted in monkey dorsal premotor cortex, of a manyfold higher performance {BCI} than previously reported. These results indicate that a fast and accurate key selection system, capable of operating with a range of keyboard sizes, is possible (up to 6.5 bits per second, or approximately 15 words per minute, with 96 electrodes). The highest information throughput is achieved with unprecedentedly brief neural recordings, even as recording quality degrades over time. These performance results and their implications for system design should substantially increase the clinical viability of {BCIs} in humans.},

These data reveal diverse gene expression patterns and remarkable conservation of each individual gene's expression among individuals (95\%), cortical areas (84\%), and between human and mouse (79\%). A small but substantial number of genes (21\%) exhibited species-differential expression. Distinct molecular signatures, comprised of genes both common between species and unique to each, were identified for each major cortical cell type. The data suggest that gene expression profile changes may contribute to differential cortical function across species, and in particular, a shift from corticosubcortical to more predominant corticocortical communications in the human brain.},

A variant of this problem is solved during the development of the fly’s nervous system, when sensory organ precursor ({SOP)} cells are chosen. By studying {SOP} selection, we derived a fast algorithm for {MIS} selection that combines two attractive features. First, processors do not need to know their degree; second, it has an optimal message complexity while only using one-bit messages. Our findings suggest that simple and efficient algorithms can be developed on the basis of biologically derived insights.},

	abstract = {Brief synaptic inhibition can overwhelm a nearly coincident suprathreshold excitatory input to preclude spike generation. Surprisingly, a brief inhibitory event that occurs in a favorable time window preceding an otherwise subthreshold excitation can facilitate spiking. Such postinhibitory facilitation ({PIF)} requires that the inhibition has a short (decay) time constant tauinh. The timescale ranges of tauinh and of the window (width and timing) for {PIF} depend on the rates of neuronal subthreshold dynamics. The mechanism for {PIF} is general, involving reduction by hyperpolarization of some excitability-suppressing factor that is partially recruited at rest. Here we illustrate and analyze {PIF}, experimentally and theoretically, using brain stem auditory neurons and a conductance-based five-variable model. In this auditory case, {PIF} timescales are in the sub- to few millisecond range and the primary mechanistic factor is a low-threshold potassium conductance {gKLT.} Competing dynamic influences create the favorable time window: hyperpolarization that moves V away from threshold and hyperexcitability resulting from reduced {gKLT.} A two-variable reduced model that retains the dynamics only of V and {gKLT} displays a similar time window. We analyze this model in the phase plane; its geometry has generic features. Further generalizing, we show that {PIF} behavior may occur even in a very reduced model with linear subthreshold dynamics, by using an integrate-and-fire model with an accommodating voltage-dependent threshold. Our analyses of {PIF} provide insights for fast inhibition's facilitatory effects in longer trains. Periodic subthreshold excitatory inputs can lead to firing, even one for one, if brief inhibitory inputs are interleaved within a range of favorable phase lags. The temporal specificity of inhibition's facilitating effect could play a role in temporal processing, in sensitivity to inhibitory and excitatory temporal patterning, in the auditory and other neural systems.},

These intracellular dynamics underlie the primary features of place-cell rate and temporal codes.

We therefore analyzed relationships of adjacency and crossing between cerebral fiber pathways in four nonhuman primate species and in humans by using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging. The cerebral fiber pathways formed a rectilinear three-dimensional grid continuous with the three principal axes of development. Cortico-cortical pathways formed parallel sheets of interwoven paths in the longitudinal and medio-lateral axes, in which major pathways were local condensations. Cross-species homology was strong and showed emergence of complex gyral connectivity by continuous elaboration of this grid structure. This architecture naturally supports functional spatio-temporal coherence, developmental path-finding, and incremental rewiring with correlated adaptation of structure and function in cerebral plasticity and evolution.},

	abstract = {The inferior colliculus ({IC)} can be divided into three anatomical subdivisions: the central nucleus ({ICc)}, the dorsal cortex ({ICd)} and the external cortex ({ICx).} {ICx} receives its primary auditory inputs from {ICc} and auditory cerebral cortical areas, and non-auditory inputs from regions of motor and other sensory systems. This wide array of projections makes the {ICx} a distinct structure within the auditory brainstem. The purpose of the current study was to comprehensively characterize the neuronal population of {ICx}, by intrinsic and synaptic response properties. Visual whole-cell patch clamp recordings were taken from {ICx} neurons (N=129) from rats between postnatal days 8 to 12. Neurons displayed various types of firing patterns in response to current injection, including regular, adapting, pauser and bursting. The regular cells constitute the majority (66\%), followed by adapting (18\%), pauser (13\%) and bursting cells (2\%). In response to hyperpolarizing current injection, many neurons illustrated a pronounced sag in the membrane potential, representing a hyperpolarization-activated current (I(h)). Some neurons (25\%) displayed a Ca(2+)-dependent rebound depolarization following negative current injection. In response to depolarizing current injection, 70\% of {ICx} neurons displayed a Ca(2+)-mediated potential expressed as Ca(2+) spikes/humps, uncovered when Na(+) and K(+) currents were removed. Also, spikes displayed an undershoot which was in part mediated by Ca(2+). Stimulation of the {ICc} elicited graded synaptic responses, which displayed a combination of excitatory and/or inhibitory potentials, with excitation being predominant across firing patterns. Neurons displayed temporal summation in response to repetitive stimulation at 20 Hz and higher. The results indicate a relatively modest diversity in firing pattern and in intrinsic membrane properties, making this subnucleus distinct from its counterparts within the {IC.} The data show that {ICx} receives major excitatory input from {ICc}, supporting its role in integrating signals from brainstem and directing information to higher brain centers.},

Biomedical literature currently increases at a rate of several thousand papers per week, making automated information retrieval methods the only feasible method of managing this expanding corpus. With the increasing prevalence of open-access journals and constant growth of publicly-available repositories of biomedical literature, literature mining has become much more effective with respect to the extraction of biomedically-relevant data. In recent years, text mining of popular databases such as {MEDLINE} has evolved from basic term-searches to more sophisticated natural language processing techniques, indexing and retrieval methods, structural analysis and integration of literature with associated metadata. In this review, we will focus on Latent Semantic Indexing ({LSI)}, a computational linguistics technique increasingly used for a variety of biological purposes. It is noted for its ability to consistently outperform benchmark Boolean text searches and co-occurrence models at information retrieval and its power to extract indirect relationships within a data set. {LSI} has been used successfully to formulate new hypotheses, generate novel connections from existing data, and validate empirical data.},

We identify and verify a new set of differentially expressed genes in the striatonigral and striatopallidal neurons, two functionally and clinically important projection neuron subtypes in the basal ganglia. We further demonstrate that Ebf1 is a lineage-specific transcription factor essential to the differentiation of striatonigral neurons.

	abstract = {Postnatal inhibitory neuron development affects mammalian brain function, and failure of this maturation process may underlie pathological conditions such as epilepsy, schizophrenia, and depression. Furthermore, understanding how physiological properties of inhibitory neurons change throughout development is critical to understanding the role(s) these cells play in cortical processing. One subset of inhibitory neurons that may be affected during postnatal development is somatostatin-expressing ({SOM)} cells. A subset of these cells is labeled with green-fluorescent protein ({GFP)} in a line of mice known as the {GFP-positive} inhibitory neurons ({GIN)} line. Here, we studied how intrinsic electrophysiological properties of these cells changed in the somatosensory cortex of {GIN} mice between postnatal ages P11 and P32+. {GIN} cells were targeted for whole-cell current-clamp recordings and ranges of positive and negative current steps were presented to each cell. The results showed that as the neocortical circuitry matured during this critical time period multiple intrinsic and firing properties of {GIN} inhibitory neurons, as well as those of excitatory (regular-spiking [{RS])} cells, were altered. Furthermore, these changes were such that the output of {GIN} cells, but not {RS} cells, increased over this developmental period. We quantified changes in excitability by examining the input-output relationship of both {GIN} and {RS} cells. We found that the firing frequency of {GIN} cells increased with age, while the rheobase current remained constant across development. This created a multiplicative increase in the input-output relationship of the {GIN} cells, leading to increases in gain with age. The input-output relationship of the {RS} cells, on the other hand, showed primarily a subtractive shift with age, but no substantial change in gain. These results suggest that as the neocortex matures, inhibition coming from {GIN} cells may become more influential in the circuit and play a greater role in the modulation of neocortical activity.},

	abstract = {Multiple factors simultaneously affect the spiking activity of individual neurons. Determining the effects and relative importance of these factors is a challenging problem in neurophysiology. We propose a statistical framework based on the point process likelihood function to relate a neuron's spiking probability to three typical covariates: the neuron's own spiking history, concurrent ensemble activity, and extrinsic covariates such as stimuli or behavior. The framework uses parametric models of the conditional intensity function to define a neuron's spiking probability in terms of the covariates. The discrete time likelihood function for point processes is used to carry out model fitting and model analysis. We show that, by modeling the logarithm of the conditional intensity function as a linear combination of functions of the covariates, the discrete time point process likelihood function is readily analyzed in the generalized linear model ({GLM)} framework. We illustrate our approach for both {GLM} and non-{GLM} likelihood functions using simulated data and multivariate single-unit activity data simultaneously recorded from the motor cortex of a monkey performing a visuomotor pursuit-tracking task. The point process framework provides a flexible, computationally efficient approach for maximum likelihood estimation, goodness-of-fit assessment, residual analysis, model selection, and neural decoding. The framework thus allows for the formulation and analysis of point process models of neural spiking activity that readily capture the simultaneous effects of multiple covariates and enables the assessment of their relative importance.},

L1s have considerably influenced mammalian genome evolution by retrotransposing during germ cell development or early embryogenesis, leading to massive genome expansion. In humans, over 30 \% of the genome can be attributed to L1-mediated retrotransposition. Historically, L1s were thought to only retrotranspose during gametogenesis and in neoplastic processes, but recent studies have shown that L1s are extremely active in the mouse, rat, and human neuronal progenitor cells ({NPCs).} In fact, it is estimated that the hippocampus and other regions of the brain may have multiple insertions per cell. These insertions can dramatically impact neuronal transcriptional expression, creating unique transcriptomes of individual neurons. Furthermore, transcriptional activation of L1 elements mimics the transcription activation of the {NeuroD1} gene, suggesting a prominent role of L1 expression during neurogenesis.},

We explored the architecture of maximum entropy models of the functional interaction networks underlying the response of large populations of retinal ganglion cells, in adult tiger salamander retina, responding to natural and artificial stimuli. We found that we can further simplify these pairwise models by neglecting weak interaction terms or by relying on a small set of interaction strengths. Comparing network interactions under different visual stimuli, we show the existence of local network motifs in the interaction map of the retina. Our results demonstrate that the underlying interaction map of the retina is sparse and dominated by local overlapping interaction modules.},

	abstract = {Sensory information may be represented in the brain by stereotyped mapping of axonal inputs or by patterning that varies between individuals. In olfaction, a stereotyped map is evident in the first sensory processing centre, the olfactory bulb ({OB)}, where different odours elicit activity in unique combinatorial patterns of spatially invariant glomeruli1, 2. Activation of each glomerulus is relayed to higher cortical processing centres by a set of {\textasciitilde}20–50 ‘homotypic’ mitral and tufted ({MT)} neurons3. In the cortex, target neurons integrate information from multiple glomeruli to detect distinct features of chemically diverse odours4, 5, 6. How this is accomplished remains unclear, perhaps because the cortical mapping of glomerular information by individual {MT} neurons has not been described. Here we use new viral tracing and three-dimensional brain reconstruction methods to compare the cortical projections of defined sets of {MT} neurons. We show that the gross-scale organization of the {OB} is preserved in the patterns of axonal projections to one processing centre yet reordered in another, suggesting that distinct coding strategies may operate in different targets. However, at the level of individual neurons neither glomerular order nor stereotypy is preserved in either region. Rather, homotypic {MT} neurons from the same glomerulus innervate broad regions that differ between individuals. Strikingly, even in the same animal, {MT} neurons exhibit extensive diversity in wiring; axons of homotypic {MT} pairs diverge from each other, emit primary branches at distinct locations and 70–90\% of branches of homotypic and heterotypic pairs are non-overlapping. This pronounced reorganization of sensory maps in the cortex offers an anatomic substrate for expanded combinatorial integration of information from spatially distinct glomeruli and predicts an unanticipated role for diversification of otherwise similar output neurons.},

The human brain confronts the same problem in everyday perception, extracting from its high-dimensional sensory inputs-30,000 auditory nerve fibers or 10(6) optic nerve fibers-a manageably small number of perceptually relevant features. Here we describe an approach to solving dimensionality reduction problems that uses easily measured local metric information to learn the underlying global geometry of a data set. Unlike classical techniques such as principal component analysis ({PCA)} and multidimensional scaling ({MDS)}, our approach is capable of discovering the nonlinear degrees of freedom that underlie complex natural observations, such as human handwriting or images of a face under different viewing conditions. In contrast to previous algorithms for nonlinear dimensionality reduction, ours efficiently computes a globally optimal solution, and, for an important class of data manifolds, is guaranteed to converge asymptotically to the true structure.},

In the olfactory system, distributed neural activity in the nose is converted into a segregated map in the olfactory bulb1, 2, 3. Here we investigate how this ordered representation is transformed in higher olfactory centres in mice. We have developed a tracing strategy to define the neural circuits that convey information from individual glomeruli in the olfactory bulb to the piriform cortex and the cortical amygdala. The spatial order in the bulb is discarded in the piriform cortex; axons from individual glomeruli project diffusely to the piriform without apparent spatial preference. In the cortical amygdala, we observe broad patches of projections that are spatially stereotyped for individual glomeruli. These projections to the amygdala are overlapping and afford the opportunity for spatially localized integration of information from multiple glomeruli. The identification of a distributive pattern of projections to the piriform and stereotyped projections to the amygdala provides an anatomical context for the generation of learned and innate behaviours.},

We observed forward and backward replay of B even when rats had been performing A for {\textgreater}10 min. Furthermore, replay of nonlocal sequence B occurred more often when B was infrequently experienced. Neither forward nor backward sequences preferentially represented highly experienced trajectories within a session. Additionally, we observed the construction of never-experienced novel-path sequences. These observations challenge the idea that sequence activation during {SWRs} is a simple replay of recent experience. Instead, replay reflected all physically available trajectories within the environment, suggesting a potential role in active learning and maintenance of the cognitive map.},

	abstract = {High-impedance, sharp intracellular electrodes were compared with whole cell patch electrodes by recording from single spinal neurons in immobilized frog tadpoles. A range of neuron properties were examined using sharp or patch test electrodes while making simultaneous recordings with a second control patch electrode. Overall, test patch electrodes did not significantly alter the activity recorded by the control electrode, and recordings from the two electrodes were essentially identical. In contrast, sharp electrode recordings differed from initial control patch recordings. In some cases, differences were due to real changes in neuron properties: the resting membrane potential became less negative and the neuron input resistance (R(i)) fell; this fall was larger for neurons with a higher R(i). In other cases, the control patch electrode revealed that differences were due to the recording properties of the sharp electrode: tip potentials were larger and more variable; resting potentials appeared to be more negative; and spike amplitude was attenuated. However, sharp electrode penetration did not, in most cases, significantly alter the pattern of neuron firing in response to injected current or the normal pattern of activity following sensory stimulation or during fictive swimming. We conclude that sharp electrodes introduce a significant leak to the membrane of tadpole spinal neurons compared with patch electrodes but that this does not change the fundamental firing characteristics or activity of the neurons.},

In mammals, olfactory sensory neurons ({OSNs)} expressing a specific odorant receptor ({OR)} gene project with precise stereotypy onto mitral/tufted ({M/T)} cells in the main olfactory bulb ({MOB).} It remains challenging to understand how incoming olfactory signals are transformed into outputs of {M/T} cells. By recording from {OSNs} expressing mouse I7 receptor and their postsynaptic neurons in the bulb, we found that I7 {OSNs} and their corresponding {M/T} cells exhibit similarly selective tuning profiles at low concentrations. Increasing the concentration significantly reduces response selectivity for both {OSNs} and {M/T} cells, although the tuning curve of {M/T} cells remains comparatively narrow. By contrast, interneurons in the {MOB} are broadly tuned, and blocking {GABAergic} neurotransmission reduces selectivity of {M/T} cells at high odorant concentrations. Our results indicate that olfactory information carried by an {OR} is channeled to its corresponding {M/T} cells and support the role of lateral inhibition via interneurons in sharpening the tuning of {M/T} {cells.Video} Abstract},

	abstract = {The manner in which groups of neurons represent events in the external world is a central question in neuroscience. Estimation of the information encoded by small groups of neurons has shown that in many neural systems, cells carry mildly redundant information. These measures average over all the activity patterns of a neural population. Here, we analyze the population code of the salamander and guinea pig retinas by quantifying the information conveyed by specific multicell activity patterns. Synchronous spikes, even though they are relatively rare and highly informative, convey less information than the sum of either spike alone, making them redundant coding symbols. Instead, patterns of spiking in one cell and silence in others, which are relatively common and often overlooked as special coding symbols, were found to be mostly synergistic. Our results reflect that the mild average redundancy between ganglion cells that was previously reported is actually the result of redundant and synergistic multicell patterns, whose contributions partially cancel each other when taking the average over all patterns. We further show that similar coding properties emerge in a generic model of neural responses, suggesting that this form of combinatorial coding, in which specific compound patterns carry synergistic or redundant information, may exist in other neural circuits.},

Increasing total {ORN} activity also makes {PN} responses more transient. Strikingly, a model with just two variables (feedforward and total {ORN} activity) accurately predicts {PN} odor responses. Finally, we show that discrimination by a linear decoder is facilitated by two complementary transformations: the saturating transformation intrinsic to each processing channel boosts weak signals, while normalization helps equalize responses to different stimuli.},

	abstract = {This chapter describes corrections that have to be applied to measured membrane potentials in patch clamp experiments. Some of them [Eqs. (1)–(3)] are required regardless of the nature of the reference electrode (in the Ringer's solution bath) whenever the pipette-filling solution is different from the bath solution. They represent the liquid junction potentials that are present at the pipette tip before patch formation. In addition, corrections have to be applied when the bath solution is being changed during a measurement (i.e., after seal formation). In that case the following rules apply. (1) The new solution should never get into contact with the bare silver/silver chloride wire of the reference electrode. This requirement is best met by using a salt bridge. (2) The “best” salt bridge is a 3 M {KCl} bridge with an abrupt {KCl-bath} fluid boundary at its tip (see above). This bridge does not require any additional potential corrections, but it may lead to {KCl} poisoning of the bath or become contaminated by solutions used previously. (3) Local solution changes (microperfusion by puffer pipette, U tool or sewer pipe arrangements) as well as recessed {KCl} bridges require additional corrections, which (together with the simple liquid junction potential correction) are approximately given by Eqs. (6)–(8).

It should be stressed that all equations given here represent approximate corrections, since liquid junction potentials are thermodynamically ill-defined. This is particularly relevant for Eqs. (6) and (7) where the sum of two liquid junction potentials appears.},

	abstract = {The postendocytic recycling of signaling receptors is subject to multiple requirements. Why this is so, considering that many other proteins can recycle without apparent requirements, is a fundamental question. Here we show that cells can leverage these requirements to switch the recycling of the beta-2 adrenergic receptor ({B2AR)}, a prototypic signaling receptor, between sequence-dependent and bulk recycling pathways, based on extracellular signals. This switch is determined by protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation of {B2AR} on the cytoplasmic tail. The phosphorylation state of {B2AR} dictates its partitioning into spatially and functionally distinct endosomal microdomains mediating bulk and sequence-dependent recycling, and also regulates the rate of {B2AR} recycling and resensitization. Our results demonstrate that G protein-coupled receptor recycling is not always restricted to the sequence-dependent pathway, but may be reprogrammed as needed by physiological signals. Such flexible reprogramming might provide a versatile method for rapidly modulating cellular responses to extracellular signaling.},

L1s comprise nearly approximately 20\% of the human genome and are able to influence chromosome integrity and gene expression upon reinsertion. Recent studies show that L1 elements are active and 'jumping' during neuronal differentiation. New somatic L1 insertions could generate 'genomic plasticity' in neurons by causing variation in genomic {DNA} sequences and by altering the transcriptome of individual cells. Thus, L1-induced variation could affect neuronal plasticity and behavior. We discuss potential consequences of L1-induced neuronal diversity and propose that a mechanism for generating diversity in the brain could broaden the spectrum of behavioral phenotypes that can originate from any single genome.},

We determined parameters of an adapting threshold model using data recorded in vitro from 24 layer 5 pyramidal neurons from rat somatosensory cortex, stimulated intracellularly by a fluctuating current simulating synaptic bombardment in vivo. The model generates output spikes whenever the membrane voltage (a filtered version of the input current) reaches a dynamic threshold. We find that for input currents with large fluctuation amplitude, up to 75\% of the spike times can be predicted with a precision of +/-2 ms. Some of the intrinsic neuronal unreliability can be accounted for by a noisy threshold mechanism. Our results suggest that, under random current injection into the soma, (i) neuronal behavior in the subthreshold regime can be well approximated by a simple linear filter; and (ii) most of the nonlinearities are captured by a simple threshold process.},

These ideas are not new, but should be re-examined in the light of recent experimental findings: trial-to-trial variability is often correlated across neurons, across trials, greater for higher-order neurons, and reduced by attention, suggesting that “intrinsic” sources of noise can only account for a minimal part of it. While it is obviously difficult to control for all internal variables, the problem of reference time can be largely avoided by recording multiple neurons at the same time, and looking at statistical structures in relative latencies. These relative latencies have another major advantage: they are insensitive to the variability that is shared across neurons, which is often a significant part of the total variability. Thus, we suggest that signal-to-noise ratios in the brain may be much higher than usually thought, leading to reactive systems, economic in terms of number of neurons, and energy efficient.},

	abstract = {Networks of living neurons exhibit diverse patterns of activity, including oscillations, synchrony, and waves. Recent work in physics has shown yet another mode of activity in systems composed of many nonlinear units interacting locally. For example, avalanches, earthquakes, and forest fires all propagate in systems organized into a critical state in which event sizes show no characteristic scale and are described by power laws. We hypothesized that a similar mode of activity with complex emergent properties could exist in networks of cortical neurons. We investigated this issue in mature organotypic cultures and acute slices of rat cortex by recording spontaneous local field potentials continuously using a 60 channel multielectrode array. Here, we show that propagation of spontaneous activity in cortical networks is described by equations that govern avalanches. As predicted by theory for a critical branching process, the propagation obeys a power law with an exponent of -3/2 for event sizes, with a branching parameter close to the critical value of 1. Simulations show that a branching parameter at this value optimizes information transmission in feedforward networks, while preventing runaway network excitation. Our findings suggest that "neuronal avalanches" may be a generic property of cortical networks, and represent a mode of activity that differs profoundly from oscillatory, synchronized, or wave-like network states. In the critical state, the network may satisfy the competing demands of information transmission and network stability.},

Yet, psychophysics has revealed that people take into account stimulus uncertainty when performing sensory or motor computations and do so in a nearly Bayes-optimal way. This suggests that neural populations do not encode just a single value but an entire probability distribution over the stimulus. Several such probabilistic codes have been proposed, including one that utilizes the structure of neural variability to enable simple neural implementations of probabilistic computations such as optimal cue integration. This approach provides a quantitative link between Bayes-optimal behaviors and specific neural operations. It allows for novel ways to evaluate probabilistic codes and for predictions for physiological population recordings.},

Correlated firing has been linked to stimulus encoding, attention, stimulus discrimination, and motor behaviour. Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying correlated spiking are poorly understood, and its coding implications are still debated. It is not clear, for instance, whether correlations between the discharges of two neurons are determined solely by the correlation between their afferent currents, or whether they also depend on the mean and variance of the input. We addressed this question by computing the spike train correlation coefficient of unconnected pairs of in vitro cortical neurons receiving correlated inputs. Notably, even when the input correlation remained fixed, the spike train output correlation increased with the firing rate, but was largely independent of spike train variability. With a combination of analytical techniques and numerical simulations using 'integrate-and-fire' neuron models we show that this relationship between output correlation and firing rate is robust to input heterogeneities. Finally, this overlooked relationship is replicated by a standard threshold-linear model, demonstrating the universality of the result. This connection between the rate and correlation of spiking activity links two fundamental features of the neural code.},

	abstract = {The study of the neural basis of olfaction is important both for understanding the sense of smell and for understanding the mechanisms of neural computation. In the olfactory bulb ({OB)}, the spatial patterning of both sensory inputs and synaptic interactions is crucial for processing odor information, although this patterning alone is not sufficient. Recent studies have suggested that representations of odor may already be distributed and dynamic in the first olfactory relay. The growing evidence demonstrating a functional role for the temporal structure of bulbar neuronal activity supports this assumption. However, the detailed mechanisms underlying this temporal structure have never been thoroughly studied. Our study focused on gamma (40-100 Hz) network oscillations in the mammalian {OB}, which is a form of temporal patterning in bulbar activity elicited by olfactory stimuli. We used computational modeling combined with electrophysiological recordings to investigate the basic synaptic organization necessary and sufficient to generate sustained gamma rhythms. We found that features of gamma oscillations obtained in vitro were identical to those of a model based on lateral inhibition as the coupling modality (i.e., low irregular firing rate and high oscillation stability). In contrast, they differed substantially from those of a model based on lateral excitatory coupling (i.e., high regular firing rate and instable oscillations). Therefore we could precisely tune the oscillation frequency by changing the kinetics of inhibitory events supporting the lateral inhibition. Moreover, gradually decreasing {GABAergic} synaptic transmission decreased the degree of relay neuron synchronization in response to sensory inputs, both theoretically and experimentally. Thus we have shown that lateral inhibition provides a mechanism by which the dynamic processing of odor information might be finely tuned within the {OB} circuit.},

In the rodent somatosensory system, the spatially diffuse feedback projection from vibrissal motor cortex ({vM1)} to vibrissal somatosensory cortex ({vS1}, also known as the barrel cortex) may allow whisker touch to be interpreted in the context of whisker position to compute object location. When mice palpate objects with their whiskers to localize object features, whisker touch excites {vS1} and later {vM1} in a somatotopic manner. Here we use axonal calcium imaging to track activity in {vM1--{\textgreater}vS1} afferents in L1 of the barrel cortex while mice performed whisker-dependent object localization. Spatially intermingled individual axons represent whisker movements, touch and other behavioural features. In a subpopulation of axons, activity depends on object location and persists for seconds after touch. Neurons in the barrel cortex thus have information to integrate movements and touches of multiple whiskers over time, key components of object identification and navigation by active touch.},

Here we examined the co-expression network of 26 genes associated with {ASD}, using data from the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas, which provides a whole-genome, high-resolution map of gene expression pattern in the adult mouse brain. We discovered that autism genes are significantly more co-expressed than expected by chance, suggesting common neuro-functional properties. We then examined the spatial properties of co-expression modules that are highly enriched with autism genes. Consequently, we found that genes in two of these modules are significantly over-expressed in the cerebellar cortex, and particularly in sections that are predominantly populated by granular cells. These findings provide the essential link between gene networks associated with {ASD} and specific brain regions, and hence lay out a basis for further exploration of the particular neuronal circuits involved in {ASD} etiology.},

Scientific discovery is an iterative process, where a published study generates new knowledge and data, resulting in new follow-up studies or clinical trials based on these results. As such, it is important for the results of a study to be quickly confirmed or discarded to avoid wasting time and money on novel projects. The availability of high-quality, reproducible data will also lead to more powerful analyses (or meta-analyses) where multiple data sets are combined to generate new knowledge. In this article, we review some of the recent developments regarding biomedical reproducibility and comparability and discuss some of the areas where the overall field could be improved.},

The importance of this problem derives from the fact that, once extracted, the data can be handled in a way similar to instances of a traditional database. The approaches proposed in the literature to address the problem of Web data extraction use techniques borrowed from areas such as natural language processing, languages and grammars, machine learning, information retrieval, databases, and ontologies. As a consequence, they present very distinct features and capabilities which make a direct comparison difficult to be done. In this paper, we propose a taxonomy for characterizing Web data extraction fools, briefly survey major Web data extraction tools described in the literature, and provide a qualitative analysis of them. Hopefully, this work will stimulate other studies aimed at a more comprehensive analysis of data extraction approaches and tools for Web data.},

This implies that neurons both represent probability distributions and combine those distributions according to a close approximation to Bayes' rule. At first sight, it would seem that the high variability in the responses of cortical neurons would make it difficult to implement such optimal statistical inference in cortical circuits. We argue that, in fact, this variability implies that populations of neurons automatically represent probability distributions over the stimulus, a type of code we call probabilistic population codes. Moreover, we demonstrate that the Poisson-like variability observed in cortex reduces a broad class of Bayesian inference to simple linear combinations of populations of neural activity. These results hold for arbitrary probability distributions over the stimulus, for tuning curves of arbitrary shape and for realistic neuronal variability.},

For success in both competitive and cooperative interactions, however, this ability must be extended to include representations of others' belief about our intentions, their model about our belief about their intentions, and so on. We developed a "stag hunt" game in which human subjects interacted with a computerized agent using different degrees of sophistication (recursive inferences) and applied an ecologically valid computational model of dynamic belief inference. We show that rostral medial prefrontal (paracingulate) cortex, a brain region consistently identified in psychological tasks requiring mentalizing, has a specific role in encoding the uncertainty of inference about the other's strategy. In contrast, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex encodes the depth of recursion of the strategy being used, an index of executive sophistication. These findings reveal putative computational representations within prefrontal cortex regions, supporting the maintenance of cooperation in complex social decision making.},

How {ORNs} encode repeated stimulation at resting, low breathing frequencies and at increased sniffing frequencies is not known, nor is it known if the olfactory transduction cascade is accurate and fast enough to follow high frequency stimulation. We investigated mouse olfactory responses to stimulus frequencies mimicking odorant exposure during low ({2Hz)} and high ({5Hz)} frequency sniffing. {ORNs} reliably follow low frequency stimulations with high fidelity by generating bursts of action potentials at each stimulation at intermediate odorant concentrations, but fail to do so at high odorant concentrations. Higher stimulus frequencies across all odorant concentrations reduced the likelihood of action potential generation, increased the latency of response, and decreased there liability of encoding the onset of stimulation. Thus an increase in stimulus frequency degrades and at high odorant concentrations entirely prevents action potential generation in individual {ORNs}, causing reduced signalling to the olfactory bulb. These results demonstrate that {ORNs} do not simply relay timing and concentration of an odorous stimulus, but also process and modulate the stimulus in a frequency-dependent manner which is controlled by the chosen sniffing rate.},

	abstract = {The vestibulo-ocular reflex ({VOR)} is characterized by a short-latency, high-fidelity eye movement response to head rotations at frequencies up to 20 Hz. Electrophysiological studies of medial vestibular nucleus ({MVN)} neurons, however, show that their response to sinusoidal currents above 10 to 12 Hz is highly nonlinear and distorted by aliasing for all but very small current amplitudes. How can this system function in vivo when single cell response cannot explain its operation? Here we show that the necessary wide {VOR} frequency response may be achieved not by firing rate encoding of head velocity in single neurons, but in the integrated population response of asynchronously firing, intrinsically active neurons. Diffusive synaptic noise and the pacemaker-driven, intrinsic firing of {MVN} cells synergistically maintain asynchronous, spontaneous spiking in a population of model {MVN} neurons over a wide range of input signal amplitudes and frequencies. Response fidelity is further improved by a reciprocal inhibitory link between two {MVN} populations, mimicking the vestibular commissural system in vivo, but only if asynchrony is maintained by noise and pacemaker inputs. These results provide a previously missing explanation for the full range of {VOR} function and a novel account of the role of the intrinsic pacemaker conductances in {MVN} cells. The values of diffusive noise and pacemaker currents that give optimal response fidelity yield firing statistics similar to those in vivo, suggesting that the in vivo network is tuned to optimal performance. While theoretical studies have argued that noise and population heterogeneity can improve coding, to our knowledge this is the first evidence indicating that these parameters are indeed tuned to optimize coding fidelity in a neural control system in vivo.},

	abstract = {The spiking activity of nearby cortical neurons is not independent. Numerous studies have explored the importance of this correlated responsivity for visual coding and perception, often by comparing the information conveyed by pairs of simultaneously recorded neurons with the sum of information provided by the respective individual cells. Pairwise responses typically provide slightly more information so that encoding is weakly synergistic. The simple comparison between pairwise and summed individual responses conflates several forms of correlation, however, making it impossible to judge the relative importance of synchronous spiking, basic tuning properties, and stimulus-independent and stimulus-dependent correlation. We have applied an information theoretic approach to this question, using the responses of pairs of neurons to drifting sinusoidal gratings of different directions and contrasts that have been recorded in the primary visual cortex of anesthetized macaque monkeys. Our approach allows us to break down the information provided by pairs of neurons into a number of components. This analysis reveals that, although synchrony is prevalent and informative, the additional information it provides frequently is offset by the redundancy arising from the similar tuning properties of the two cells. Thus coding is approximately independent with weak synergy or redundancy arising, depending on the similarity in tuning and the temporal precision of the analysis. We suggest that this would allow cortical circuits to enjoy the stability provided by having similarly tuned neurons without suffering the penalty of redundancy, because the associated information transmission deficit is compensated for by stimulus-dependent synchrony.},

This structure provides a model for all class B {GPCRs} and may aid in the design of new small-molecule drugs for diseases of brain and metabolism.},

	abstract = {The mammalian olfactory system recognizes an enormous variety of odorants carrying a wide range of important behavioral cues. In the main olfactory bulb ({MOB)}, odorants are ultimately represented through the action potential activity of mitral/tufted cells ({M/Ts)}, whose selectivity and tuning to odorant molecules are therefore fundamental determinants of {MOB} sensory coding. However, the sheer number and diversity of discrete olfactory stimuli has been a major barrier to comprehensively evaluating {M/T} selectivity. To address this issue, we assessed {M/T} odorant responses in anesthetized mice to a 348-odorant panel widely and systematically distributed throughout chemical space, presented both individually and in mixtures at behaviorally relevant concentrations. We found that {M/T} activation by odorants was markedly selective, with neurons responding robustly, sensitively, and reliably to only a highly restricted subset of stimuli. Multiple odorants activating a single neuron commonly shared clear structural similarity, but {M/T} tuning also frequently extended beyond obviously defined chemical categories. Cells typically responded to effective compounds presented both individually and in mixtures, although firing rates evoked by mixtures typically showed partial suppression. Response selectivity was further confirmed in awake animals by chronic recordings of {M/Ts.} These data indicate that individual {M/Ts} encode specific odorant attributes shared by only a small fraction of compounds and imply that the {MOB} relays the collective molecular features of an odorant stimulus through a restricted set of {M/Ts}, each narrowly tuned to a particular stimulus characteristic.},

From the perspective of understanding a single cell's spiking activity relative to a behavior or stimulus, these network fluctuations are typically considered to be noise. We show that these events are highly correlated with another commonly recorded signal, the local field potential ({LFP)}, and are also likely related to global network state phenomena which have been observed in a number of neural systems. Moreover, we show that attributing a component of cell firing to these network fluctuations via explicit modeling of the {LFP} improves the recovery of cell properties. This suggests that the impact of network fluctuations may be estimated using the {LFP}, and that a portion of this network activity is unrelated to the stimulus and instead reflects ongoing cortical activity. Thus, the {LFP} acts as an easily accessible bridge between the network state and the spiking activity.},

As a matter of fact, studies of the functional expression of olfactory receptors have not demonstrated the low or high specificity of olfactory receptors. In this study, the selectivity of olfactory receptor neurons was investigated in the rat at the cellular level under physiological conditions by unitary extracellular recordings. Individual olfactory receptor neurons were broadly responsive to qualitatively distinct odor compounds.

We investigate the shape of the likelihood function for this type of model, give a simple condition on the nonlinearity ensuring that no non-global local maxima exist in the likelihood-leading, in turn, to efficient algorithms for the computation of the maximum likelihood estimator-and discuss the implications for the form of the allowed nonlinearities.

Such optimal maps have recently been shown to possess cognitively desirable properties and are likely to be used by the nervous system to organize sensory information. The algorithm derived here turns out to be one proposed by Goodall for pairwise decorrelation. It is biologically plausible since in a neural network implementation it requires only data available locally to a neuron. In training over ensembles of two-dimensional input signals with the same spatial power spectrum as natural scenes, networks develop output neurons with center-surround receptive fields similar to those of ganglion cells in the retina. Some technical issues pertinent to developmental algorithms of this sort, such as “symmetry fixing,” are also discussed.},

The most striking commonality among the resulting patterns of gene expression is the extent to which cytoarchitectural boundaries within the hippocampus are respected, although the complexity of these patterns could not have been predicted on the basis of the microarray data alone. Among those genes with expression that can be characterized as “restricted” to neurons in one or more subregions of the hippocampus are a number of signal transduction molecules, transcription factors, calcium-binding proteins, and carbohydrate-modifying enzymes. These results suggest that important determinants of the unique identities of adult hippocampal neurons are differential signal transduction, regulation of gene expression, calcium homeostasis, and the maintenance of a unique extracellular milieu. Furthermore, the extremely high correlation between microarray data and in situ expression demonstrates the great utility of using {DNA} microarrays to genetically profile discrete brain regions.},

Two modes of propagation have been studied: synfire chains, in which synchronous activity travels through feedforward layers of a neuronal network, and the propagation of fluctuations in firing rate across these layers. In both cases, a sufficient amount of noise, which was added to previous models from an external source, had to be included to support stable propagation. Sparse, randomly connected networks of spiking model neurons can generate chaotic patterns of activity. We investigate whether this activity, which is a more realistic noise source, is sufficient to allow for signal transmission. We find that, for rate-coded signals but not for synfire chains, such networks support robust and accurate signal reproduction through up to six layers if appropriate adjustments are made in synaptic strengths. We investigate the factors affecting transmission and show that multiple signals can propagate simultaneously along different pathways. Using this feature, we show how different types of logic gates can arise within the architecture of the random network through the strengthening of specific synapses.},

Intracellular recordings of neuronal membrane potential are a central tool in neurophysiology. In many situations, especially in vivo, the traditional limitation of such recordings is the high electrode resistance and capacitance, which may cause significant measurement errors during current injection. We introduce a computer-aided technique, Active Electrode Compensation ({AEC)}, based on a digital model of the electrode interfaced in real time with the electrophysiological setup. The characteristics of this model are first estimated using white noise current injection. The electrode and membrane contribution are digitally separated, and the recording is then made by online subtraction of the electrode contribution. Tests performed in vitro and in vivo demonstrate that {AEC} enables high-frequency recordings in demanding conditions, such as injection of conductance noise in dynamic-clamp mode, not feasible with a single high-resistance electrode until now. {AEC} should be particularly useful to characterize fast neuronal phenomena intracellularly in vivo.},

A total of 650 cells were recorded intracellularly comprising all regions of the thalamus; of these 229 fulfilled our criterion for recording stability and were used as the data base for this report. The resting membrane potential for thirty-four representative neurones which were analysed in detail was -64 +/- 5 {mV} (mean +/- {S.D.)}, input resistance 42 +/- 18 M omega, and action potential amplitude 80 +/- 7 {mV.} Intracellular staining with horseradish peroxidase and Lucifer Yellow revealed that the recorded cells had different morphology. In some their axonal trajectory characterized them as thalamo-cortical relay cells. Two main types of neuronal firing were observed. From a membrane potential negative to -60 {mV}, anti- or orthodromic and direct activation generated a single burst of spikes, consisting of a low-threshold spike (l.t.s.) of low amplitude and a set of fast superimposed spikes. Tonic repetitive firing was observed if the neurones were activated from a more positive membrane potential; this was a constant finding in all but two of the cells which fulfilled the stability criteria. The l.t.s. response was totally inactivated at membrane potentials positive to -55 {mV.} As the membrane was hyperpolarized from this level the amplitude of the l.t.s. increased and became fully developed at potentials negative to -70 {mV.} This increase is due to a de-inactivation of the ionic conductance generating this response. After activation the l.t.s. showed refractoriness for approximately 170 ms. Deinactivation of l.t.s. is a voltage- and time-dependent process; full de-inactivation after a step hyperpolarization to maximal l.t.s. amplitude (-75 to -80 {mV)} requires 150-180 ms. Membrane depolarization positive to -55 {mV} generated sudden sustained depolarizing 'plateau potentials', capable of supporting repetitive firing (each action potential being followed by a marked after-hyperpolarization, a.h.p.). The a.h.p. and the plateau potential controlled the voltage trajectory during the interspike interval and, with the fast spike, constitute a functional state where the thalamic neurone displayed oscillatory properties. Frequency-current (f-I) plots from different initial levels of membrane potential were obtained by the application of square current pulses of long duration (2s). From resting membrane potential and from hyperpolarized levels a rather stereotyped onset firing rate was observed due to the presence of the l.t.s.({ABSTRACT} {TRUNCATED} {AT} 400 {WORDS)}},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} Spatially mapped large scale gene expression databases enable quantitative comparison of data measurements across genes, anatomy, and phenotype. In most ongoing efforts to study gene expression in the mammalian brain, significant resources are applied to the mapping and visualization of data. This paper describes the implementation and utility of Brain Explorer, a {3D} visualization tool for studying in situ hybridization-based ({ISH)} expression patterns in the Allen Brain Atlas, a genome-wide survey of 21,000 expression patterns in the {C57BL{\textbackslash}6J} adult mouse brain. {RESULTS} Brain Explorer enables users to visualize gene expression data from the {C57Bl/6J} mouse brain in {3D} at a resolution of 100 microm3, allowing co-display of several experiments as well as 179 reference neuro-anatomical structures. Brain Explorer also allows viewing of the original {ISH} images referenced from any point in a {3D} data set. Anatomic and spatial homology searches can be performed from the application to find data sets with expression in specific structures and with similar expression patterns. This latter feature allows for anatomy independent queries and genome wide expression correlation studies. {CONCLUSION} These tools offer convenient access to detailed expression information in the adult mouse brain and the ability to perform data mining and visualization of gene expression and neuroanatomy in an integrated manner.},

	abstract = {Odors evoke complex spatiotemporal responses in the insect antennal lobe ({AL)} and mammalian olfactory bulb. However, the behavioral relevance of spatiotemporal coding remains unclear. In the present work we combined behavioral analyses with calcium imaging of odor induced activity in the honeybee {AL} to evaluate the relevance of this temporal dimension in the olfactory code. We used a new way for evaluation of odor similarity of binary mixtures in behavioral studies, which involved testing whether a match of odor-sampling time is necessary between training and testing conditions for odor recognition during associative learning. Using graded changes in the similarity of the mixture ratios, we found high correlations between the behavioral generalization across those mixtures and a gradient of activation in {AL} output. Furthermore, short odor stimuli of 500 ms or less affected how well odors were matched with a memory template, and this time corresponded to a shift from a sampling-time-dependent to a sampling-time-independent memory. Accordingly, 375 ms corresponded to the time required for spatiotemporal {AL} activity patterns to reach maximal separation according to imaging studies. Finally, we compared spatiotemporal representations of binary mixtures in trained and untrained animals. {AL} activity was modified by conditioning to improve separation of odor representations. These data suggest that one role of reinforcement is to "tune" the {AL} such that relevant odors become more discriminable.},

	abstract = {Neural correlates of learning and memory formation have been reported at different stages of the olfactory pathway in both vertebrates and invertebrates. However, the contribution of different neurons to the formation of a memory trace is little understood. Mushroom bodies ({MBs)} in the insect brain are higher-order structures involved in integration of olfactory, visual, and mechanosensory information and in memory formation. Here we focus on the ensemble spiking activity of single {MB} output neurons ({ENs)} when honeybees learned to associate an odor with reward. A large group of {ENs} (∼50\%) changed their odor response spectra by losing or gaining sensitivity for specific odors. This response switching was dominated by the rewarded stimulus ({CS+)}, which evoked exclusively recruitment. The remaining {ENs} did not change their qualitative odor spectrum but modulated their tuning strength, again dominated by increased responses to the {CS+.} While the bees showed a conditioned response (proboscis extension) after a few acquisition trials, no short-term effects were observed in the neuronal activity. In both {EN} types, associative plastic changes occurred only during retention 3 h after conditioning. Thus, long-term but not short-term memory was reflected by increased {EN} activity to the {CS+.} During retention, the {EN} ensemble separated the {CS+} most differently from the {CS−} and control odors ∼140 ms after stimulus onset. The learned behavioral response appeared ∼330 ms later. It is concluded that after memory consolidation, the ensemble activity of the {MB} output neurons predicts the meaning of the stimulus (reward) and may provide the prerequisite for the expression of the learned behavior.},

We observe an expression gradient of A-type K+ channels that weakens the backpropagating action potential-mediated depolarization in layer 1a compared with layer 1b. We find that the pairing of presynaptic and postsynaptic firing leads to significantly smaller Ca2+ signals in the distal dendritic spines in layer 1a compared with the proximal spines in layer 1b. The consequence is a selective failure to induce long-term potentiation ({LTP)} in layer 1a, which can be rescued by pharmacological enhancement of action potential backpropagation. In contrast, {LTP} induction by pairing presynaptic and postsynaptic firing is possible in layer 1b but requires bursting of the postsynaptic cell. This output mode strongly depends on the balance of excitation and inhibition in the piriform cortex. We show, on the single-spine level, how the plasticity of functionally distinct synapses is gated by the intrinsic electrical properties of piriform cortex layer 2 pyramidal cell dendrites and the cellular output mode.},

Layer 2 piriform cortex ({PC)} cells recieve 2 kinds of inputs on its layer 1 dendrites. Its most proximal inputs in layer 1a are from the main olfactory bulb ({MOB)} and more distal inputs onto layer 1b from other {PC} associational fibers.
These two kinds of inputs recieve differentially back propagating action potentials from the soma ({APs} backprop to 1b but not 1a). [This is an effect of the distal dendrites expressing more Kv4.2 ({IA} current) than proximal.] As a result, 1b inputs are available for plasticity via {LTP} whereas 1a synapses do not show {LTP.}
Therefore, sensory inputs do not show plasticity but associational inputs do show plasticity. This is concurrent with hippocampal {CA1} pyramidal cells which have a similar input scheme where entorhinal cortex inputs do not show plasticity but associational inputs from elsewhere in the hippocampus (like dentate gyrus and {CA3)} do show plasticitiy.
I wonder if this is a general scheme of cortical neurons which recieve both direct sensory input and associational input as well.}

We applied pattern classification techniques to characterize patterns of activity coding object-centered side, a task-defined variable specifying whether an object component was located on the left or right side of a reference object, regardless of its retinocentric position. During a period in which the value of object-centered side, as defined by task events, remained constant, parietal cortex represented this variable using a dynamic neural code by activating neurons with the same spatial preference in rapid succession so that the pattern of active neurons changed dramatically while the spatial information they collectively encoded remained stable. Furthermore, if the neurons shared the same spatial preference, then their pretrial activity (measured before objects were shown) was correlated to a degree that scaled as a positive linear function of how close together in time the neurons would be activated later in the trial. Finally, we found that while parietal cortex represented task-critical spatial information using a dynamic neural code, it simultaneously represented task-irrelevant spatial information using a stationary neural code. These data demonstrate that dynamic spatial representations exist in parietal cortex, provide novel insight into the synaptic mechanisms that generate them, and suggest they may preferentially encode task-critical spatial information.},

	abstract = {Neurons respond to sensory stimuli by altering the rate and temporal pattern of action potentials. These spike trains both encode and propagate information that guides behavior. Local inhibitory networks can affect the information encoded and propagated by neurons by altering correlations between different spike trains. Correlations introduce redundancy that can reduce encoding but also facilitate propagation of activity to downstream targets. Given this trade-off, how can networks maximize both encoding and propagation efficacy? Here, we examine this problem by measuring the effects of olfactory bulb inhibition on the pairwise statistics of mitral cell spiking. We evoked spiking activity in the olfactory bulb in vitro and measured how lateral inhibition shapes correlations across timescales. We show that inhibitory circuits simultaneously increase fast correlation (i.e., synchrony increases) and decrease slow correlation (i.e., firing rates become less similar). Further, we use computational models to show the benefits of fast correlation/slow decorrelation in the context of odor coding. Olfactory bulb inhibition enhances population-level discrimination of similar inputs, while improving propagation of mitral cell activity to cortex. Our findings represent a targeted strategy by which a network can optimize the correlation structure of its output in a dynamic, activity-dependent manner. This trade-off is not specific to the olfactory system, but rather our work highlights mechanisms by which neurons can simultaneously accomplish multiple, and sometimes competing, aspects of sensory processing.},

Although such variability has potential advantages in robustness and reliability, how and why biological circuits assemble heterogeneous cells into functional groups is poorly understood. Here, we develop analytic approaches toward answering how neuron-level variation in intrinsic biophysical properties of olfactory bulb mitral cells influences population coding of fluctuating stimuli. We capture the intrinsic diversity of recorded populations of neurons through a statistical approach based on generalized linear models. These models are flexible enough to predict the diverse responses of individual neurons yet provide a common reference frame for comparing one neuron to the next. We then use Bayesian stimulus decoding to ask how effectively different populations of mitral cells, varying in their diversity, encode a common stimulus. We show that a key advantage provided by physiological levels of intrinsic diversity is more efficient and more robust encoding of stimuli by the population as a whole. However, we find that the populations that best encode stimulus features are not simply the most heterogeneous, but those that balance diversity with the benefits of neural similarity.},

	abstract = {{"How} is information decoded in the brain?" is one of the most difficult and important questions in neuroscience. We have developed a general framework for investigating to what extent the decoding process in the brain can be simplified. First, we hierarchically constructed simplified probabilistic models of neural responses that ignore more than Kth-order correlations using the maximum entropy principle. We then computed how much information is lost when information is decoded using these simplified probabilistic models (i.e., "mismatched decoders"). To evaluate the information obtained by mismatched decoders, we introduced an information theoretic quantity, I*, which was derived by extending the mutual information in terms of communication rate across a channel. We showed that I* provides consistent results with the minimum mean-square error as well as the mutual information, and demonstrated that a previously proposed measure quantifying the importance of correlations in decoding substantially deviates from I* when many cells are analyzed. We then applied this proposed framework to spike data for vertebrate retina using short natural scene movies of 100 ms duration as a set of stimuli and computing the information contained in neural activities. Although significant correlations were observed in population activities of ganglion cells, information loss was negligibly small even if all orders of correlation were ignored in decoding. We also found that, if we inappropriately assumed stationarity for long durations in the information analysis of dynamically changing stimuli, such as natural scene movies, correlations appear to carry a large proportion of total information regardless of their actual importance.},

These neurones were also excitable but differed from locus coeruleus neurones in that they showed accommodation to depolarizing current pulses and time-dependent anomalous rectification with hyper-polarizing current pulses. In {MNV} neurones focal stimulation did not give rise to {DSPs.} Intracellular injection of Lucifer yellow revealed that the cell bodies of locus coeruleus neurones were small and multipolar whereas {MNV} neurones had larger, monopolar cell bodies.},

	abstract = {Neural activity in primary motor cortex ({MI)} is known to correlate with hand position and velocity. Previous descriptions of this tuning have (1) been linear in position or velocity, (2) depended only instantaneously on these signals, and/or (3) not incorporated the effects of interneuronal dependencies on firing rate. We show here that many {MI} cells encode a superlinear function of the full time-varying hand trajectory. Approximately 20\% of {MI} cells carry information in the hand trajectory beyond just the position, velocity, and acceleration at a single time lag. Moreover, approximately one-third of {MI} cells encode the trajectory in a significantly superlinear manner; as one consequence, even small position changes can dramatically modulate the gain of the velocity tuning of {MI} cells, in agreement with recent psychophysical evidence. We introduce a compact nonlinear "preferred trajectory" model that predicts the complex structure of the spatiotemporal tuning functions described in previous work. Finally, observing the activity of neighboring cells in the {MI} network significantly increases the predictability of the firing rate of a single {MI} cell; however, we find interneuronal dependencies in {MI} to be much more locked to external kinematic parameters than those described recently in the hippocampus. Nevertheless, this neighbor activity is approximately as informative as the hand velocity, supporting the view that neural encoding in {MI} is best understood at a population level.},

	abstract = {Rodents can discriminate odors in one breath, and mammalian olfaction research has thus focused on the first breath. However, sensory representations dynamically change during and after stimuli. To investigate these dynamics, we recorded spike trains from the olfactory bulb of awake, head-fixed mice and found that some mitral cells’ odor representations changed following the first breath and others continued after odor cessation. Population analysis revealed that these postodor responses contained odor- and concentration-specific information—an odor afterimage. Using calcium imaging, we found that most olfactory glomerular activity was restricted to the odor presentation, implying that the afterimage is not primarily peripheral. The odor afterimage was not dependent on odorant physicochemical properties. To artificially induce aftereffects, we photostimulated mitral cells using channelrhodopsin and recorded centrally maintained persistent activity. The strength and persistence of the afterimage was dependent on the duration of both artificial and natural stimulation. In summary, we show that the odor representation evolves after the first breath and that there is a centrally maintained odor afterimage, similar to other sensory systems. These dynamics may help identify novel odorants in complex environments.},

	abstract = {Spike-timing variability has a large effect on neural information processing. However, for many systems little is known about the noise sources causing the spike-response variability. Here we investigate potential sources of spike-response variability in auditory receptor neurons of locusts, a classic insect model system. At low-spike frequencies, our data show negative interspike-interval ({ISI)} correlations and {ISI} distributions that match the inverse Gaussian distribution. These findings can be explained by a white-noise source that interacts with an adaptation current. At higher spike frequencies, more strongly peaked distributions and positive {ISI} correlations appear, as expected from a canonical model of suprathreshold firing driven by temporally correlated (i.e., colored) noise. Simulations of a minimal conductance-based model of the auditory receptor neuron with stochastic ion channels exclude the delayed rectifier as a possible noise source. Our analysis suggests channel noise from an adaptation current and the receptor or sodium current as main sources for the colored and white noise, respectively. By comparing the {ISI} statistics with generic models, we find strong evidence for two distinct noise sources. Our approach does not involve any dendritic or somatic recordings that may harm the delicate workings of many sensory systems. It could be applied to various other types of neurons, in which channel noise dominates the fluctuations that shape the neuron's spike statistics.},

	abstract = {The lack of a deeper understanding of how olfactory sensory neurons ({OSNs)} encode odors has hindered the progress in understanding the olfactory signal processing in higher brain centers. Here we employ methods of system identification to investigate the encoding of time-varying odor stimuli and their representation for further processing in the spike domain by Drosophila {OSNs.} In order to apply system identification techniques, we built a novel low-turbulence odor delivery system that allowed us to deliver airborne stimuli in a precise and reproducible fashion. The system provides a 1\% tolerance in stimulus reproducibility and an exact control of odor concentration and concentration gradient on a millisecond time scale. Using this novel setup, we recorded and analyzed the in-vivo response of {OSNs} to a wide range of time-varying odor waveforms. We report for the first time that across trials the response of {OR59b} {OSNs} is very precise and reproducible. Further, we empirically show that the response of an {OSN} depends not only on the concentration, but also on the rate of change of the odor concentration. Moreover, we demonstrate that a two-dimensional ({2D)} Encoding Manifold in a concentration-concentration gradient space provides a quantitative description of the neuron's response. We then use the white noise system identification methodology to construct one-dimensional ({1D)} and two-dimensional ({2D)} Linear-Nonlinear-Poisson ({LNP)} cascade models of the sensory neuron for a fixed mean odor concentration and fixed contrast. We show that in terms of predicting the intensity rate of the spike train, the {2D} {LNP} model performs on par with the {1D} {LNP} model, with a root mean-square error ({RMSE)} increase of about 5 to 10\%. Surprisingly, we find that for a fixed contrast of the white noise odor waveforms, the nonlinear block of each of the two models changes with the mean input concentration. The shape of the nonlinearities of both the {1D} and the {2D} {LNP} model appears to be, for a fixed mean of the odor waveform, independent of the stimulus contrast. This suggests that white noise system identification of Or59b {OSNs} only depends on the first moment of the odor concentration. Finally, by comparing the {2D} Encoding Manifold and the {2D} {LNP} model, we demonstrate that the {OSN} identification results depend on the particular type of the employed test odor waveforms. This suggests an adaptive neural encoding model for Or59b {OSNs} that changes its nonlinearity in response to the odor concentration waveforms.},

Here we reexamine these assumptions in networks of spiking neurons by using orientation selectivity as an example. We compare two principal classes of model: one in which the tuning curves are sharpened through cortical lateral interactions, and one in which they are not. We report that sharpening through lateral interactions does not improve population codes but, on the contrary, leads to a severe loss of information. In addition, the sharpening models generate complicated codes that rely extensively on pairwise correlations. Our study generates several experimental predictions that can be used to distinguish between these two classes of model.},

Full characteristics including cognitive functions of the brain should ultimately be comprehended by building simulators capable of precisely mirroring spike responses of a variety of neurons. Neuronal modeling that had remained on a qualitative level has recently advanced to a quantitative level, but is still incapable of accurately predicting biological data and requires high computational cost. In this study, we devised a simple, fast computational model that can be tailored to any cortical neuron not only for reproducing but also for predicting a variety of spike responses to greatly fluctuating currents. The key features of this model are a multi-timescale adaptive threshold predictor and a nonresetting leaky integrator. This model is capable of reproducing a rich variety of neuronal spike responses, including regular spiking, intrinsic bursting, fast spiking, and chattering, by adjusting only three adaptive threshold parameters. This model can express a continuous variety of the firing characteristics in a three-dimensional parameter space rather than just those identified in the conventional discrete categorization. Both high flexibility and low computational cost would help to model the real brain function faithfully and examine how network properties may be influenced by the distributed characteristics of component neurons.},

Multiple-site monitoring of units allowed for the determination of their two-dimensional spatial position in the brain. Of the [{\textasciitilde}]60,000 cell pairs recorded, 0.2\% showed robust short-term interactions. Units with significant, short-latency ({\textless}3 ms) peaks following their action potentials in their cross-correlograms were characterized as putative excitatory (pyramidal) cells.

Neurons physiologically identified as inhibitory and excitatory cells were used as templates for classification of all recorded neurons.

We discuss a variety of examples, applying these direct optimization techniques to problems in spike train smoothing, stimulus decoding, parameter estimation, and inference of synaptic properties. Along the way, we point out connections to some related standard statistical methods, including spline smoothing and isotonic regression. Finally, we note that the computational methods reviewed here do not in fact depend on the state-space setting at all; instead, the key property we are exploiting involves the bandedness of certain matrices. We close by discussing some applications of this more general point of view, including Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for neural decoding and efficient estimation of spatially-varying firing rates.},

	abstract = {We present an integrative formalism of mutual information expansion, the general Poisson exact breakdown, which explicitly evaluates the informational contribution of correlations in the spike counts both between and within neurons. The formalism was validated on simulated data and applied to real neurons recorded from the rat somatosensory cortex. From the general Poisson exact breakdown, a considerable number of mutual information measures introduced in the neural computation literature can be directly derived, including the exact breakdown (Pola, Thiele, Hoffmann, \& Panzeri, 2003), the Poisson exact breakdown (Scaglione, Foffani, Scannella, Cerutti, \& Moxon, 2008) the synergy and redundancy between neurons (Schneidman, Bialek, \& Berry, 2003), and the information lost by an optimal decoder that assumes the absence of correlations between neurons (Nirenberg \& Latham, 2003; Pola et al., 2003). The general Poisson exact breakdown thus offers a convenient set of building blocks for studying the role of correlations in population codes.},

There is evidence that sensory systems migrate from a distributed and redundant encoding strategy at the periphery to a more heterogeneous encoding in cortical structures. It has been hypothesized that heterogeneity is an efficient encoding strategy that minimizes the redundancy of the neural code and maximizes information throughput. Evidence of this mechanism has been documented in cortical structures. In this study, we examined whether heterogeneous encoding of complex sounds contributes to efficient encoding in the auditory midbrain by characterizing neural responses to behaviorally relevant vocalizations in the mouse inferior colliculus ({IC).} We independently manipulated the frequency, amplitude, duration, and harmonic structure of the vocalizations to create a suite of modified vocalizations. Based on measures of both spike rate and timing, we characterized the heterogeneity of neural responses to the natural vocalizations and their perturbed variants. Using information theoretic measures, we found that heterogeneous response properties of {IC} neurons contribute to efficient encoding of behaviorally relevant vocalizations.},

	abstract = {Unlike the neocortex, sensory input to the piriform cortex is anatomically segregated in layer 1, making it ideal for studying the dendritic integration of synaptic inputs pivotal for sensory information processing. Here we investigated dendritic integration of olfactory bulb inputs in pyramidal cells using dual patch-clamp recordings along the soma-apical dendritic axis. We found that these dendrites are relatively compact with 50\% maximal somatic current loss for synaptic inputs arriving at distal dendritic regions. Distal dendrites could generate small and fast local spikes, but they had little impact on the soma, indicating that they are only weakly active. In contrast to the neocortex, we found no evidence for dendritic Ca2+ or {NMDA} spikes though these dendrites actively supported action potential backpropagation with concomitant entry of Ca2+ ions. Based on experiments and simulations we suggest that regardless of dendritic location, olfactory bulb inputs have nearly uniform potency and are distributed diffusely over the distal apical tree (layer Ia), thereby minimizing sublinear summation effects. This indicates that any stimulus feature extraction performed by these cells will occur at the soma and is based on the nearly linear sum of olfactory bulb inputs, rather than on explicitly designed clusters of functionally related synapses in the dendritic tree.},

Cortical layers were estimated on the basis of current source density profiles with histological verifications, and the interlaminar signal flow was determined with cross-correlation analysis between spike trains. During the cue period, canonical “feed-forward” signals flowed from granular to supragranular layers and from supragranular to infragranular layers. During the delay period, however, the signal flow reversed to the “feed-back” direction: from infragranular to supragranular layers. This reversal of signal flow highlights how the temporal cortex differentially recruits its laminar circuits for sensory and mnemonic processing.},

Point mutations in the human voltage-gated potassium channel (Kv1.1) gene on chromosome 12p13 have recently been shown to associate with {EA1.} A Scottish family with {EA1} harbouring a novel mutation in this gene is reported. Of the five affected individuals over three generations, two had partial epilepsy in addition to {EA1.} The detailed clinical, electrophysiological and molecular genetic findings are presented. The heterozygous point mutation is located at nucleotide position 677 and results in a radical amino acid substitution at a highly conserved position in the second transmembrane domain of the potassium channel. Functional studies indicated that mutant subunits exhibited a dominant negative effect on potassium channel function and would be predicted to impair neuronal repolarization. Potassium channels determine the excitability of neurons and blocking drugs are proconvulsant. A critical review of previously reported {EA1} families shows an over-representation of epilepsy in family members with {EA1} compared with unaffected members. These observations indicate that this mutation is pathogenic and suggest that the epilepsy in {EA1} may be caused by the dysfunctional potassium channel. It is possible that such dysfunction may be relevant to other epilepsies in man.},

	abstract = {Author {SummarySensory} neurons are capable of representing a wide array of computations on sensory stimuli. Such complex computations are thought to arise in large part from the accumulation of relatively simple nonlinear operations across the sensory processing hierarchies. However, models of sensory processing typically rely on mathematical approximations of the overall relationship between stimulus and response, such as linear or quadratic expansions, which can overlook critical elements of sensory computation and miss opportunities to reveal how the underlying inputs contribute to a neuron's response. Here we present a physiologically inspired nonlinear modeling framework, the {‘Nonlinear} Input Model’ ({NIM)}, which instead assumes that neuronal computation can be approximated as a sum of excitatory and suppressive ‘neuronal inputs’. We show that this structure is successful at explaining neuronal responses in a variety of sensory areas. Furthermore, model fitting can be guided by prior knowledge about the inputs to a given neuron, and its results can often suggest specific physiological predictions. We illustrate the advantages of the proposed model and demonstrate specific parameter estimation procedures using a range of example sensory neurons in both the visual and auditory systems.},

We found that these signatures are associated with differences in expression of neuronal and oligodendrocyte markers, suggesting they reflect regional differences in cellular populations. We also find that the expression level of these genes is correlated with connectivity degree, with regions expressing the neuron-enriched pattern having more incoming and outgoing connections with other regions.

We argue that the retinal goal is to transform the visual input as much as possible into a statistically independent basis as the first step in creating a redundancy reduced representation in the cortex, as suggested by Barlow. The extent of this whitening of the input is limited, however, by the need to suppress input noise. Our explicit theoretical solutions for the retinal filters also show a simple dependence on mean stimulus luminance: they predict an approximate Weber law at low spatial frequencies and a De Vries-Rose law at high frequencies. Assuming that the dominant source of noise is quantum, we generate a family of contrast sensitivity curves as a function of mean luminance. This family is compared to psychophysical data.},

	abstract = {Learning is thought to facilitate the recognition of objects by optimizing the tuning of visual neurons to behaviorally relevant features. However, the learning mechanisms that shape neural selectivity for visual forms in the human brain remain essentially unknown. Here, we combine behavioral and functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI)} measurements to test the mechanisms that mediate enhanced behavioral sensitivity in the discrimination of visual forms after training. In particular, we used high-resolution {fMRI} and multivoxel pattern classification methods to investigate fine learning-dependent changes in neural preference for global forms. We measured the observers' choices when discriminating between concentric and radial patterns presented in noise before and after training. Similarly, we measured the choices of a pattern classifier when predicting each stimulus from {fMRI} activity. Comparing the performance of human observers and classifiers demonstrated that learning alters the observers' sensitivity to visual forms and the tuning of {fMRI} activation patterns in visual areas selective for task-relevant features. In particular, training on low-signal stimuli enhanced the amplitude but reduced the width of pattern-based tuning functions in higher dorsal and ventral visual areas. Thus, our findings suggest that learning of visual patterns is implemented by enhancing the response to the preferred stimulus category and reducing the response to nonpreferred stimuli in higher extrastriate visual cortex.},

	abstract = {Mitral and tufted cells of the olfactory bulb receive strong gamma-aminobutyric acid ({GABA)-ergic} input and express {GABA(A)} receptors containing the alpha1 or alpha3 subunit. The distribution of these subunits was investigated in rats via multiple immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy, by using gephyrin as a marker of {GABAergic} synapses. A prominent immunoreactivity was detected throughout the external plexiform layer ({EPL)} and glomerular layer ({GL).} However, although staining for the alpha1 subunit was uniform throughout the {EPL}, that of the alpha3 subunit was most intense in the outer one-third of this layer. All mitral cells were positive for the alpha1 subunit. In contrast, the alpha3 subunit was restricted to a subpopulation of mitral cells, many of which also expressed calretinin. Likewise, external tufted cells could be subdivided into distinct groups, either singly labeled for the alpha1 or alpha3 subunit or doubly labeled. At the subcellular level, staining for the alpha1 and alpha3 subunits was punctate, forming clusters partially colocalized with gephyrin. However, many alpha1- and alpha3-positive clusters lacked gephyrin, suggesting the existence of either nonsynaptic {GABA(A)} receptor clusters or synaptic receptors not associated with gephyrin. Quantitative analysis of colocalization among the three markers in the inner {EPL}, outer {EPL}, and {GL} revealed considerable heterogeneity, suggestive of a differential organization of {GABA(A)} receptor subtypes in the apical and basal dendrites of mitral and tufted cells. Together these results reveal a complex subunit organization of {GABA(A)} receptors in the olfactory bulb and suggest that mitral and tufted cells participate in different synaptic circuits controlled by distinct {GABA(A)} receptor subtypes.},

	abstract = {The network architecture of functional connectivity within the human brain connectome is poorly understood at the voxel level. Here, using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging data from 1003 healthy adults, we investigate a broad array of network centrality measures to provide novel insights into connectivity within the whole-brain functional network (i.e., the functional connectome). We first assemble and visualize the voxel-wise (4 mm) functional connectome as a functional network. We then demonstrate that each centrality measure captures different aspects of connectivity, highlighting the importance of considering both global and local connectivity properties of the functional connectome. Beyond “detecting functional hubs,” we treat centrality as measures of functional connectivity within the brain connectome and demonstrate their reliability and phenotypic correlates (i.e., age and sex). Specifically, our analyses reveal age-related decreases in degree centrality, but not eigenvector centrality, within precuneus and posterior cingulate regions. This implies that while local or (direct) connectivity decreases with age, connections with hub-like regions within the brain remain stable with age at a global level. In sum, these findings demonstrate the nonredundancy of various centrality measures and raise questions regarding their underlying physiological mechanisms that may be relevant to the study of neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders.},

	abstract = {Individual pyramidal neurons of neocortex show sparse and variable responses to sensory stimuli in vivo. It has remained unclear how this variability extends to population responses on a trial-to-trial basis. Here, we characterized single-neuron and population responses to whisker stimulation in layer 2/3 (L2/3) of identified columns in rat barrel cortex using in vivo two-photon calcium imaging. Optical detection of single action potentials from evoked calcium transients revealed low spontaneous firing rates (0.25 Hz), variable response probabilities (range, 0-0.5; mean, 0.2 inside barrel column), and weak angular tuning of L2/3 neurons. On average, both the single-neuron response probability and the percentage of the local population activated were higher in the barrel column than above septa or in neighboring columns. Within the barrel column, mean response probability was highest in the center (0.4) and declined toward the barrel border. Neuronal pairs showed correlations in both spontaneous and sensory-evoked activity that depended on the location of the neurons. Correlation decreased with increasing distance between neurons and, for neuronal pairs the same distance apart, with distance of the pair from the barrel column center. Although neurons are therefore not activated independently from each other, we did not observe precisely repeating spatial activation patterns. Instead, population responses showed large trial-to-trial variability. Nevertheless, the accuracy of decoding stimulus onset times from local population activity increased with population size and depended on anatomical location. We conclude that, despite their sparseness and variability, L2/3 population responses show a clear spatial organization on the columnar scale.},

Cortical architecture and computational studies suggest that lateral interactions among neurons could help resolve local uncertainty about disparity encoded in individual neurons by incorporating contextual constraints. We found that correlated activity among pairs of neurons in primary visual cortex depended both on disparity-tuning relationships and the stimuli displayed within the receptive fields of the neurons. Nearby pairs of neurons with distinct disparity tuning exhibited a decrease in spike correlation at competing disparities soon after response onset. Distant neuronal pairs of similar disparity tuning exhibited an increase in spike correlation at mutually preferred disparities. The observed correlated activity and response dynamics suggests that local competitive and distant cooperative interactions improve disparity tuning of individual neurons over time. Such interactions could represent a neural substrate for the principal constraints underlying cooperative stereo algorithms.},

	abstract = {Postnatal inhibitory neuron development affects mammalian brain function, and failure of this maturation process may underlie pathological conditions such as epilepsy, schizophrenia, and depression. Furthermore, understanding how physiological properties of inhibitory neurons change throughout development is critical to understanding the role(s) these cells play in cortical processing. One subset of inhibitory neurons that may be affected during postnatal development is somatostatin-expressing ({SOM)} cells. A subset of these cells is labeled with green-fluorescent protein ({GFP)} in a line of mice known as the {GFP-positive} inhibitory neurons ({GIN)} line. Here, we studied how intrinsic electrophysiological properties of these cells changed in the somatosensory cortex of {GIN} mice between postnatal ages P11 and P32+. {GIN} cells were targeted for whole-cell current-clamp recordings and ranges of positive and negative current steps were presented to each cell. The results showed that as the neocortical circuitry matured during this critical time period multiple intrinsic and firing properties of {GIN} inhibitory neurons, as well as those of excitatory (regular-spiking [{RS])} cells, were altered. Furthermore, these changes were such that the output of {GIN} cells, but not {RS} cells, increased over this developmental period. We quantified changes in excitability by examining the input–output relationship of both {GIN} and {RS} cells. We found that the firing frequency of {GIN} cells increased with age, while the rheobase current remained constant across development. This created a multiplicative increase in the input–output relationship of the {GIN} cells, leading to increases in gain with age. The input–output relationship of the {RS} cells, on the other hand, showed primarily a subtractive shift with age, but no substantial change in gain. These results suggest that as the neocortex matures, inhibition coming from {GIN} cells may become more influential in the circuit and play a greater role in the modulation of neocortical activity.},

	abstract = {Cortical information processing originates from the exchange of action potentials between many cell types. To capture the essence of these interactions, it is of critical importance to build mathematical models that reflect the characteristic features of spike generation in individual neurons. We propose a framework to automatically extract such features from current-clamp experiments, in particular the passive properties of a neuron (i.e., membrane time constant, reversal potential, and capacitance), the spike-triggered adaptation currents, as well as the dynamics of the action potential threshold. The stochastic model that results from our maximum likelihood approach accurately predicts the spike times, the subthreshold voltage, the firing patterns, and the type of frequency-current curve. Extracting the model parameters for three cortical cell types revealed that cell types show highly significant differences in the time course of the spike-triggered currents and moving threshold, that is, in their adaptation and refractory properties but not in their passive properties. In particular, {GABAergic} fast-spiking neurons mediate weak adaptation through spike-triggered currents only, whereas regular spiking excitatory neurons mediate adaptation with both moving threshold and spike-triggered currents. {GABAergic} nonfast-spiking neurons combine the two distinct adaptation mechanisms with reduced strength. Differences between cell types are large enough to enable automatic classification of neurons into three different classes. Parameter extraction is performed for individual neurons so that we find not only the mean parameter values for each neuron type but also the spread of parameters within a group of neurons, which will be useful for future large-scale computer simulations.},

Next, we quantified the efficacy of information transmission between stimulus and response using mutual information. By systematically changing the ratio of excitation/inhibition ({E/I)} in vitro and in a network model, we discovered that both information capacity and information transmission are maximized at a particular intermediate {E/I}, at which ongoing activity emerges as neuronal avalanches. Next, we used our in vitro and model results to correctly predict in vivo information capacity and interactions between neuronal groups during ongoing activity. Close agreement between our experiments and model suggest that neuronal avalanches and peak information capacity arise because of criticality and are general properties of cortical networks with balanced {E/I.}},

Each memory is stored in a different high-frequency ("40 hertz") subcycle of a low-frequency oscillation. Memory patterns repeat on each low-frequency (5 to 12 hertz) oscillation, a repetition that relies on activity-dependent changes in membrane excitability rather than reverberatory circuits.

	abstract = {The lack of a deeper understanding of how olfactory sensory neurons ({OSNs)} encode odors has hindered the progress in understanding the olfactory signal processing in higher brain centers. Here we employ methods of system identification to investigate the encoding of time-varying odor stimuli and their representation for further processing in the spike domain by Drosophila {OSNs.} In order to apply system identification techniques, we built a novel low-turbulence odor delivery system that allowed us to deliver airborne stimuli in a precise and reproducible fashion. The system provides a 1\% tolerance in stimulus reproducibility and an exact control of odor concentration and concentration gradient on a millisecond time scale. Using this novel setup, we recorded and analyzed the in-vivo response of {OSNs} to a wide range of time-varying odor waveforms. We report for the first time that across trials the response of {OR59b} {OSNs} is very precise and reproducible. Further, we empirically show that the response of an {OSN} depends not only on the concentration, but also on the rate of change of the odor concentration. Moreover, we demonstrate that a two-dimensional ({2D)} Encoding Manifold in a concentration-concentration gradient space provides a quantitative description of the neuron's response. We then use the white noise system identification methodology to construct one-dimensional ({1D)} and two-dimensional ({2D)} Linear-Nonlinear-Poisson ({LNP)} cascade models of the sensory neuron for a fixed mean odor concentration and fixed contrast. We show that in terms of predicting the intensity rate of the spike train, the {2D} {LNP} model performs on par with the {1D} {LNP} model, with a root mean-square error ({RMSE)} increase of about 5 to 10\%. Surprisingly, we find that for a fixed contrast of the white noise odor waveforms, the nonlinear block of each of the two models changes with the mean input concentration. The shape of the nonlinearities of both the {1D} and the {2D} {LNP} model appears to be, for a fixed mean of the odor waveform, independent of the stimulus contrast. This suggests that white noise system identification of Or59b {OSNs} only depends on the first moment of the odor concentration. Finally, by comparing the {2D} Encoding Manifold and the {2D} {LNP} model, we demonstrate that the {OSN} identification results depend on the particular type of the employed test odor waveforms. This suggests an adaptive neural encoding model for Or59b {OSNs} that changes its nonlinearity in response to the odor concentration waveforms.},

In a novel space, the ensemble code was initially less robust but improved rapidly with exploration. During this period, the activity of many inhibitory cells was suppressed, which suggests that new spatial information creates conditions in the hippocampal circuitry that are conducive to the synaptic modification presumed to be involved in learning. Development of a new population code for a novel environment did not substantially alter the code for a familiar one, which suggests that the interference between the two spatial representations was very small.

The intrinsic ionic currents of these cell types were investigated in acutely dissociated neurons from 3- to 4-wk-old mice, where differences in spontaneous firing and action potential parameters observed in slice preparations are preserved. Both {GIN} and {YFP-16} neurons express a combination of four major outward currents: Ca(2+)-dependent K(+) currents (I({KCa))}, 1 {mM} {TEA-sensitive} delayed rectifier K(+) currents (I({1TEA))}, 10 {mM} {TEA-sensitive} delayed rectifier K(+) currents (I({10TEA))}, and A-type K(+) currents (I(A)). The balance of these currents varied across cells, with {GIN} neurons tending to express proportionately more I({KCa)} and I(A), and {YFP-16} neurons tending to express proportionately more I({1TEA)} and I({10TEA).} Correlations in charge densities suggested that several currents were coregulated. Variations in the kinetics and density of I({1TEA)} could account for differences in repolarization rates observed both within and between cell types. These data indicate that diversity in the firing properties of {GABAergic} and non-{GABAergic} vestibular nucleus neurons arises from graded differences in the balance and kinetics of ionic currents.},

To understand this transformation, we analyzed the odor representation in large populations of individual {M/T} cells in the Xenopus {OB.} The spontaneous [Ca(2+)] activities of {M/T} cells appeared to be irregular, but there were groups of spatially distributed neurons showing synchronized [Ca(2+)] activities. These neurons were always connected to the same glomerulus. Odorants elicited complex spatiotemporal response patterns in {M/T} cells where nearby neurons generally showed little correlation. But the responses of neurons connected to the same glomerulus were virtually identical, irrespective of whether the responses were excitatory or inhibitory, and independent of the distance between them. Synchronous neurons received correlated {EPSCs} and were coupled by electrical conductances that could account for the correlated responses. Thus, at the output stage of the {OB}, odors are represented by modules of distributed and synchronous {M/T} cells associated with the same glomeruli. This allows for parallel input to higher brain centers.},

While many models have been proposed for the visual system, few have ever been tested against this criterion. To address this issue, we have developed a general framework for fitting and validating nonlinear models of visual neurons using natural visual stimuli. Our approach derives from linear spatiotemporal receptive field ({STRF)} analysis, which has frequently been used to study the visual system. However, prior to the linear filtering stage typical of {STRFs}, a linearizing transformation is applied to the stimulus to account for nonlinear response properties. We used this approach to compare two models for neurons in primary visual cortex: a nonlinear Fourier power model, which accounts for spatial phase invariant tuning, and a traditional linear model. We characterized prediction accuracy in terms of the total explainable variance, given intrinsic experimental noise. On average, Fourier power {STRFs} predicted 40\% of explainable variance while linear {STRFs} were able to predict only 21\% of explainable variance. The performance of the Fourier power model provides a benchmark for evaluating more sophisticated models in the future.},

	abstract = {In contrast to Newton's well-known aphorism that he had been able “to see further only by standing on the shoulders of giants,” one attributes to the Spanish philosopher Ortega y Gasset the hypothesis saying that top-level research cannot be successful without a mass of medium researchers on which the top rests comparable to an iceberg.

The Ortega hypothesis predicts that highly-cited papers and medium-cited (or lowly-cited) papers would equally refer to papers with a medium impact. The Newton hypothesis would be supported if the top-level research more frequently cites previously highly-cited work than that medium-level research cites highly-cited work. Our analysis is based on (i) all articles and proceedings papers which were published in 2003 in the life sciences, health sciences, physical sciences, and social sciences, and (ii) all articles and proceeding papers which were cited within these publications. The results show that highly-cited work in all scientific fields more frequently cites previously highly-cited papers than that medium-cited work cites highly-cited work.

We demonstrate that papers contributing to the scientific progress in a field lean to a larger extent on previously important contributions than papers contributing little. These findings support the Newton hypothesis and call into question the Ortega hypothesis (given our usage of citation counts as a proxy for impact).},

Here, we analyzed the dendritic geometry and electrical excitability of these interneurons. First, dendritic polarity, measured based on the insertion points of primary dendrites on the soma surface, yielded a continuous one-dimensional measure without a clustering of dendritic polarity types. Secondly, we analyzed polar and vertical distributions of dendritic length. A cluster analysis allowed the definition of 7 types of dendritic arborization. Thirdly, when dendritic polarity was related to the intrinsic electrical excitability we found that the ratio of frequency adaptation in trains of action potentials ({APs)} evoked by current injection was correlated with the number of primary dendrites. Numerical simulations of spiking patterns in L2/3 interneurons suggested that the number of primary dendrites could account for up to 50\% of this correlation. Fourthly, dendritic arborization was not correlated with axonal projection, and axonal projection types could not be predicted by electrical excitability parameters. We conclude that 1) dendritic polarity is correlated to intrinsic electrical excitability, and 2) the axonal projection pattern represents an independent classifier of interneurons.},

Detecting and determining the significance of plasticity, however, requires assessing the intrinsic variability in neural responses. Effects such as rapid plasticity have been investigated in the auditory system through the use of the spectrotemporal receptive field ({STRF)}, a characterization of the properties of sounds to which a neuron best responds. Here we investigated neural response variability in awake recordings obtained from zebra finch field L, the analog of the primary auditory cortex. To quantify the level of variability in the neural recordings, we used three similarity measures: an {STRF-based} metric, a spike-train correlation-based metric, and a spike-train discrimination-based metric. We then extracted a number of parameters from these measures, quantifying how they fluctuated over time. Our results indicate that 1) awake responses are quite stable over time; 2) the different measures of response are complementary--specifically, the spike-train-based measures yield new information complementary to the {STRF;} and 3) different {STRF} parameters show distinct levels of variability. These results provide critical constraints for the design of robust decoding strategies and novel experiments on attention and plasticity in the awake songbird.},

This leads to an ongoing turnover of interneurons, in particular of the inhibitory granule cells, which constitute the largest cell population of the olfactory bulb. The function of this adult neurogenesis in olfactory processing is only poorly understood. Experiments show that it contributes to perceptual learning. We present a basic computational model that is built on fundamental aspects of the granule cells and their connections with the excitatory mitral cells, which convey the olfactory information to higher brain areas. We show that neurogenesis can reshape the network connectivity in response to olfactory input so as to reduce the correlations between the bulbar representations of even highly similar stimuli. The neurogenetic adaptation of the stimulus representations provides a natural explanation of the perceptual learning and the different response of young and old granule cells to novel odors that have been observed in experiments. The model makes experimentally testable predictions for training protocols that enhance the discriminability of odor mixtures.},

	abstract = {The subthalamic nucleus ({STN)} provides a second entry point for cortical input to the basal ganglia, supplementing the corticostriatal pathway. We examined the way intrinsic properties shape the response of the {STN} to cortical excitation, recording from rat {STN} in vivo and in brain slices. {STN} cells exhibited a near-zero slope conductance--and hence an effectively infinite membrane time constant--at subthreshold potentials. This makes {STN} cells exceptional temporal integrators, consistent with the common view that basal ganglia nuclei use rate coding. However, {STN} cells also exhibited a drop in spike threshold triggered by larger {EPSPs}, allowing them to fire time-locked spikes in response to coincident input. In addition to promoting coincidence detection, the threshold dynamics associated with larger {EPSPs} reduced the probability of firing spikes outside of a narrow window immediately after the stimulus, even on trials in which the {EPSP} did not directly trigger a spike. This shift in stimulus-evoked firing pattern would allow downstream structures to distinguish coincidence-triggered spikes from other spikes and thereby permit coincidence detection and rate coding to operate in parallel in the same cell. Thus, {STN} cells can combine two functions--integration and coincidence detection--that are normally considered mutually exclusive. This could support rapid communication between cortex and basal ganglia targets that bypasses the striatum without disrupting slower rate coding pathways.},

	abstract = {{CNS} axons differ in diameter (d) by nearly 100-fold (∼0.1–10 μm); therefore, they differ in cross-sectional area (d2) and volume by nearly 10,000-fold. If, as found for optic nerve, mitochondrial volume fraction is constant with axon diameter, energy capacity would rise with axon volume, also as d2. We asked, given constraints on space and energy, what functional requirements set an axon's diameter? Surveying 16 fiber groups spanning nearly the full range of diameters in five species (guinea pig, rat, monkey, locust, octopus), we found the following: (1) thin axons are most numerous; (2) mean firing frequencies, estimated for nine of the identified axon classes, are low for thin fibers and high for thick ones, ranging from ∼1 to {\textgreater}100 Hz; (3) a tract's distribution of fiber diameters, whether narrow or broad, and whether symmetric or skewed, reflects heterogeneity of information rates conveyed by its individual fibers; and (4) mitochondrial volume/axon length rises ≥d2. To explain the pressure toward thin diameters, we note an established law of diminishing returns: an axon, to double its information rate, must more than double its firing rate. Since diameter is apparently linear with firing rate, doubling information rate would more than quadruple an axon's volume and energy use. Thicker axons may be needed to encode features that cannot be efficiently decoded if their information is spread over several low-rate channels. Thus, information rate may be the main variable that sets axon caliber, with axons constrained to deliver information at the lowest acceptable rate.},

Detecting events of interest in the presence of noise and other overlapping events often necessitates the use of nonlinear transformations of inputs. The nonlinear nature of the relationships between inputs and outputs makes it difficult to characterize them experimentally given the limitations imposed by data collection. Here we discuss how minimal models of the nonlinear input/output relationships of information processing systems can be constructed by maximizing a quantity called the noise entropy. The proposed approach can be used to “focus” the available data by determining which input/output correlations are important and creating the least-biased model consistent with those correlations. We hope that this method will aid the exploration of the computations carried out by complex biological systems and expand our understanding of basic phenomena in the biological world.},

In the present work, we afford this systematic review: the different cellular and molecular mechanisms which rule the formation of the olfactory nerve, the lateral olfactory tract and the intracortical connections, as well as the few data available regarding the accessory olfactory system. These mechanisms are compared, and the implications of the differences and similarities discussed in this fundamental scenario of ontogeny.},

	abstract = {The ability to transmit, organize, and query information digitally has brought with it the challenge of how to best use this power to facilitate scientific inquiry. Today, few information systems are able to provide detailed answers to complex questions about neuroscience that account for multiple spatial scales, and which cross the boundaries of diverse parts of the nervous system such as molecules, cellular parts, cells, circuits, systems and tissues. As a result, investigators still primarily seek answers to their questions in an increasingly densely populated collection of articles in the literature, each of which must be digested individually. If it were easier to search a knowledge base that was structured to answer neuroscience questions, such a system would enable questions to be answered in seconds that would otherwise require hours of literature review. In this article, we describe {NeuroLex.org}, a wiki-based website and knowledge management system. Its goal is to bring neurobiological knowledge into a framework that allows neuroscientists to review the concepts of neuroscience, with an emphasis on multiscale descriptions of the parts of nervous systems, aggregate their understanding with that of other scientists, link them to data sources and descriptions of important concepts in neuroscience, and expose parts that are still controversial or missing. To date, the site is tracking {\textasciitilde}25,000 unique neuroanatomical parts and concepts in neurobiology spanning experimental techniques, behavioral paradigms, anatomical nomenclature, genes, proteins and molecules. Here we show how the structuring of information about these anatomical parts in the nervous system can be reused to answer multiple neuroscience questions, such as displaying all known {GABAergic} neurons aggregated in {NeuroLex} or displaying all brain regions that are known within {NeuroLex} to send axons into the cerebellar cortex.},

Studies in awake behaving animals have found that sustained responses of mitral cells to odorants are rare, suggesting sparse combinatorial representation of the odorants. Careful alignment of mitral cell firing with the phase of the respiration cycle revealed brief transient activity in the larger population of mitral cells, which respond to odorants during a small fraction of the respiration cycle. Responses of these cells are therefore temporally sparse. Here, we propose a mathematical model for the olfactory bulb network that can reproduce both combinatorially and temporally sparse mitral cell codes. We argue that sparse codes emerge as a result of the balance between mitral cells' excitatory inputs and inhibition provided by the granule cells. Our model suggests functional significance for the dendrodendritic synapses mediating interactions between mitral and granule cells.},

Second, the extended maturation and change in excitability of these neurons make this added similarity a time-dependent effect, supporting the possibility that temporal information is included in new hippocampal memories. Finally, our model suggests that the experience-dependent addition of neurons results in a dentate gyrus network well suited for encoding new memories in familiar contexts while treating novel contexts differently. Taken together, these results indicate that new granule cells may affect hippocampal function in several unique and previously unpredicted ways.},

	abstract = {{SummaryBackground} 
Paralysis or amputation of an arm results in the loss of the ability to orient the hand and grasp, manipulate, and carry objects, functions that are essential for activities of daily living. Brain–machine interfaces could provide a solution to restoring many of these lost functions. We therefore tested whether an individual with tetraplegia could rapidly achieve neurological control of a high-performance prosthetic limb using this type of an interface. 
Methods 
We implanted two 96-channel intracortical microelectrodes in the motor cortex of a 52-year-old individual with tetraplegia. Brain–machine-interface training was done for 13 weeks with the goal of controlling an anthropomorphic prosthetic limb with seven degrees of freedom (three-dimensional translation, three-dimensional orientation, one-dimensional grasping). The participant's ability to control the prosthetic limb was assessed with clinical measures of upper limb function. This study is registered with {ClinicalTrials.gov}, {NCT01364480.} 
Findings 
The participant was able to move the prosthetic limb freely in the three-dimensional workspace on the second day of training. After 13 weeks, robust seven-dimensional movements were performed routinely. Mean success rate on target-based reaching tasks was 91·6\% ({SD} 4·4) versus median chance level 6·2\% (95\% {CI} 2·0–15·3). Improvements were seen in completion time (decreased from a mean of 148 s [{SD} 60] to 112 s [6]) and path efficiency (increased from 0·30 [0·04] to 0·38 [0·02]). The participant was also able to use the prosthetic limb to do skilful and coordinated reach and grasp movements that resulted in clinically significant gains in tests of upper limb function. No adverse events were reported. 
Interpretation 
With continued development of neuroprosthetic limbs, individuals with long-term paralysis could recover the natural and intuitive command signals for hand placement, orientation, and reaching, allowing them to perform activities of daily living.

	abstract = {The amount of information encoded by networks of neurons critically depends on the correlation structure of their activity. Neurons with similar stimulus preferences tend to have higher noise correlations than others. In homogeneous populations of neurons, this limited range correlation structure is highly detrimental to the accuracy of a population code. Therefore, reduced spike count correlations under attention, after adaptation, or after learning have been interpreted as evidence for a more efficient population code. Here, we analyze the role of limited range correlations in more realistic, heterogeneous population models. We use Fisher information and maximum-likelihood decoding to show that reduced correlations do not necessarily improve encoding accuracy. In fact, in populations with more than a few hundred neurons, increasing the level of limited range correlations can substantially improve encoding accuracy. We found that this improvement results from a decrease in noise entropy that is associated with increasing correlations if the marginal distributions are unchanged. Surprisingly, for constant noise entropy and in the limit of large populations, the encoding accuracy is independent of both structure and magnitude of noise correlations.},

	abstract = {External tufted ({ET)} cells are juxtaglomerular neurons that spontaneously generate bursts of action potentials, which persist when fast synaptic transmission is blocked. The intrinsic mechanism of this autonomous bursting is unknown. We identified a set of voltage-dependent conductances that cooperatively regulate spontaneous bursting: hyperpolarization-activated inward current (I(h)), persistent Na+ current (I({NaP))}, low-voltage-activated calcium current (I({L/T))} mediated by T- and/or L-type Ca2+ channels, and large-conductance Ca2+-dependent K+ current (I({BK)).} I(h) is important in setting membrane potential and depolarizes the cell toward the threshold of I({NaP)} and I({T/L)}, which are essential to generate the depolarizing envelope that is crowned by a burst of action potentials. Action potentials depolarize the membrane and induce Ca2+ influx via high-voltage-activated Ca2+ channels (I({HVA)).} The combined depolarization and increased intracellular Ca2+ activates I({BK)}, which terminates the burst by hyperpolarizing the membrane. Hyperpolarization activates I(h) and the cycle is regenerated. A novel finding is the role of L-type Ca2+ channels in autonomous {ET} cells bursting. A second novel feature is the role of {BK} channels, which regulate burst duration. I(L) and I({BK)} may go hand-in-hand, the slow inactivation of I(L) requiring I({BK)-dependent} hyperpolarization to deactivate inward conductances and terminate the burst. {ET} cells receive monosynaptic olfactory nerve input and drive the major inhibitory interneurons of the glomerular circuit. Modulation of the conductances identified here can regulate burst frequency, duration, and spikes per burst in {ET} cells and thus significantly shape the impact of glomerular circuits on mitral and tufted cells, the output channels of the olfactory bulb.},

We argue that odorants densely sample a two-dimensional curved surface embedded in the multidimensional sensory space. This surface can account for more than half of the variance of the perceptual data. We also show that only 12\% of experimental variance cannot be explained by curved surfaces of substantially small dimensionality ({\textless}10). We suggest that these curved manifolds represent the relevant spaces sampled by the human olfactory system, thereby providing surrogates for olfactory sensory space. For the case of {2D} approximation, we relate the two parameters on the curved surface to the physico-chemical parameters of odorant molecules. We show that one of the dimensions is related to eigenvalues of molecules’ connectivity matrix, while the other is correlated with measures of molecules’ polarity. We discuss the behavioral significance of these findings.},

We survey a wide range of new methods, provide guidance on how to validate the output of the models, and clarify misconceptions and errors in the literature.

	abstract = {The spiking activity of cortical neurons is correlated. For instance, trial-to-trial fluctuations in response strength are shared between neurons, and spikes often occur synchronously. Understanding the properties and mechanisms that generate these forms of correlation is critical for determining their role in cortical processing. We therefore investigated the spatial extent and functional specificity of correlated spontaneous and evoked activity. Because feedforward, recurrent, and feedback pathways have distinct extents and specificity, we reasoned that these measurements could elucidate the contribution of each type of input. We recorded single unit activity with microelectrode arrays which allowed us to measure correlation in many hundreds of pairings, across a large range of spatial scales. Our data show that correlated evoked activity is generated by two mechanisms that link neurons with similar orientation preferences on different spatial scales: one with high temporal precision and a limited spatial extent ([{\textasciitilde}]3 mm), and a second that gives rise to correlation on a slow time scale and extends as far as we were able to measure (10 mm). The former is consistent with common input provided by horizontal connections; the latter likely involves feedback from extrastriate cortex. Spontaneous activity was correlated over a similar spatial extent, but approximately twice as strongly as evoked activity. Visual stimuli thus caused a substantial decrease in correlation, particularly at response onset. These properties and the circuit mechanism they imply provide new constraints on the functional role that correlation may play in visual processing.},

This phase shift is established by local inhibition that selectively delays mitral cell activity. Furthermore, while tufted cell phase is unperturbed in response to purely excitatory odorants, mitral cell phase is advanced in a graded, stimulus-dependent manner. Thus, phase separation by inhibition forms the basis for two distinct channels of olfactory processing.},

We calculated maximum a posteriori estimates of song spectrograms using a generalized linear model of neuronal responses and a series of prior distributions, each carrying different amounts of statistical information about zebra finch song. We found that spike trains from a population of mesencephalicus lateral dorsalis ({MLd)} neurons combined with an uncorrelated Gaussian prior can estimate the amplitude envelope of song spectrograms. The same set of responses can be combined with Gaussian priors that have correlations matched to those found across multiple zebra finch songs to yield song spectrograms similar to those presented to the animal. The fidelity of spectrogram reconstructions from {MLd} responses relies more heavily on prior knowledge of spectral correlations than temporal correlations. However, the best reconstructions combine {MLd} responses with both spectral and temporal correlations.},

We quantified the functional effect of an interaction between two optic-flow processing neurons (Vi and H1) in the fly (Lucilia sericata). Using a generative model, we estimated a uni-directional coupling from H1 to Vi. Especially at a low signal-to-noise ratio ({SNR)}, the coupling strongly improved the information about optic-flow in Vi. We identified two constraints confining the strength of the interaction. First, for weak couplings, Vi benefited from inputs by H1 without a concomitant shift of its stimulus tuning.

Such complex computations are thought to arise in large part from the accumulation of relatively simple nonlinear operations across the sensory processing hierarchies. However, models of sensory processing typically rely on mathematical approximations of the overall relationship between stimulus and response, such as linear or quadratic expansions, which can overlook critical elements of sensory computation and miss opportunities to reveal how the underlying inputs contribute to a neuron's response. Here we present a physiologically inspired nonlinear modeling framework, the {‘Nonlinear} Input Model’ ({NIM)}, which instead assumes that neuronal computation can be approximated as a sum of excitatory and suppressive ‘neuronal inputs’. We show that this structure is successful at explaining neuronal responses in a variety of sensory areas. Furthermore, model fitting can be guided by prior knowledge about the inputs to a given neuron, and its results can often suggest specific physiological predictions. We illustrate the advantages of the proposed model and demonstrate specific parameter estimation procedures using a range of example sensory neurons in both the visual and auditory systems.},

Decoding methods, which provide an explicit means for reading out the information contained in neural spike responses, offer a powerful set of tools for studying the neural coding problem. Here we develop several decoding methods based on point-process neural encoding models, or forward models that predict spike responses to stimuli. These models have concave log-likelihood functions, which allow efficient maximum-likelihood model fitting and stimulus decoding. We present several applications of the encoding model framework to the problem of decoding stimulus information from population spike responses: (1) a tractable algorithm for computing the maximum a posteriori ({MAP)} estimate of the stimulus, the most probable stimulus to have generated an observed single- or multiple-neuron spike train response, given some prior distribution over the stimulus; (2) a gaussian approximation to the posterior stimulus distribution that can be used to quantify the fidelity with which various stimulus features are encoded; (3) an efficient method for estimating the mutual information between the stimulus and the spike trains emitted by a neural population; and (4) a framework for the detection of change-point times (the time at which the stimulus undergoes a change in mean or variance) by marginalizing over the posterior stimulus distribution. We provide several examples illustrating the performance of these estimators with simulated and real neural data.},

We suggest that time-keeping is an important function of these sequences, and propose a network mechanism for their generation. We show that sequences of neuronal assemblies recorded from rat hippocampal {CA1} pyramidal cells can reliably predict elapsed time (15–20 s) during wheel running with a precision of 0.5 s. In addition, we demonstrate the generation of multiple reliable, long-lasting sequences in a recurrent network model. These sequences are generated in the presence of noisy, unstructured inputs to the network, mimicking stationary sensory input. Identical initial conditions generate similar sequences, whereas different initial conditions give rise to distinct sequences. The key ingredients responsible for sequence generation in the model are threshold-adaptation and a Mexican-hat-like pattern of connectivity among pyramidal cells. This pattern may arise from recurrent systems such as the hippocampal {CA3} region or the entorhinal cortex. We hypothesize that mechanisms that evolved for spatial navigation also support tracking of elapsed time in behaviorally relevant contexts.},

	abstract = {For a detailed description of the circuitry of cortical columns at the level of single neurons, it is essential to define the identities of the cell types that constitute these columns. For interneurons ({INs)}, we described 4 "types of axonal projection patterns" in layer 2/3 (L2/3) with reference to the outlines of a cortical column (Helmstaedter et al. 2008a). In addition we quantified the dendritic geometry and electrical excitability of 3 types of the L2/3 {INs:} "local," "lateral," and "translaminar" inhibitors (Helmstaedter et al. 2008b). Here, we used an iterated cluster analysis ({iCA)} that combines axonal projection patterns with dendritic geometry and electrical excitability parameters to identify "groups" of {INs}, from a sample of 39 cells. The {iCA} defined 9 groups of {INs.} We propose a hierarchical scheme for identifying L2/3 {INs.} First, L2/3 {INs} can be classified as 4 types of axonal projections. Second, L2/3 {INs} can be subclassified as 9 groups with a high within-group similarity of dendritic, axonal, and electrical parameters. This scheme of identifying L2/3 {INs} may help to quantitatively describe inhibitory effects on sensory stimulus representations in L2/3 of cortical columns.},

Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of sensory processing requires uncovering how connection patterns between neurons relate to their function. On a coarse scale, long-range projections can preferentially link cortical regions with similar responses to sensory stimuli1, 2, 3, 4. But on the local scale, where dendrites and axons overlap substantially, the functional specificity of connections remains unknown. Here we determine synaptic connectivity between nearby layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in vitro, the response properties of which were first characterized in mouse visual cortex in vivo. We found that connection probability was related to the similarity of visually driven neuronal activity. Neurons with the same preference for oriented stimuli connected at twice the rate of neurons with orthogonal orientation preferences. Neurons responding similarly to naturalistic stimuli formed connections at much higher rates than those with uncorrelated responses. Bidirectional synaptic connections were found more frequently between neuronal pairs with strongly correlated visual responses. Our results reveal the degree of functional specificity of local synaptic connections in the visual cortex, and point to the existence of fine-scale subnetworks dedicated to processing related sensory information.},

The visual encoding system consists of a bank of filters, modeling the visual receptive fields, in cascade with a population of neural circuits, modeling encoding in the early visual system. The neuron models considered include integrate-and-fire neurons and {ON-OFF} neuron pairs with threshold-and-fire spiking mechanisms. All thresholds are assumed to be random. We demonstrate that neural spiking is akin to taking noisy measurements on the stimulus both for time-varying and space-time-varying stimuli. We formulate the reconstruction problem as the minimization of a suitable cost functional in a finite-dimensional vector space and provide an explicit algorithm for stimulus recovery. We also present a general solution using the theory of smoothing splines in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces. We provide examples of both synthetic video as well as for natural scenes and demonstrate that the quality of the reconstruction degrades gracefully as the threshold variability of the neurons increases.},

	doi = {10.1152/jn.00160.2009},
	abstract = {During growth or degeneration neuronal surface area can change dramatically. Measurements of membrane protein concentration, as in ion channel or ionic conductance density, are often normalized by membrane capacitance, which is proportional to the surface area, to express changes independently from cell surface variations. Several electrophysiological protocols are used to measure cell capacitance, all based on the assumption of membrane isopotentiality. Yet, most neurons violate this assumption because of their complex anatomical structure, raising the question of which protocol yields measurements that are closest to the actual total membrane capacitance. We measured the capacitance of identified neurons from crab stomatogastric ganglia using three different protocols: the current-clamp step, the voltage-clamp step, and the voltage-clamp ramp protocols. We observed that the current-clamp protocol produced significantly higher capacitance values than those of either voltage-clamp protocol. Computational models of various anatomical complexities suggest that the current-clamp protocol can yield accurate capacitance estimates. In contrast, the voltage-clamp protocol estimates rapidly deteriorate as isopotentiality is reduced. We provide a mathematical description of these results by analyzing a simple two-compartment model neuron to facilitate an intuitive understanding of these methods. Together, the experiments, modeling, and mathematical analysis indicate that accurate total membrane capacitance measurements cannot be obtained with voltage-clamp protocols in nonisopotential neurons. Furthermore, although current-clamp steps can theoretically yield accurate measurements, experimentalists should be aware of limitations imposed by step duration and numerical errors during fitting procedures to obtain the membrane time constant.},

	abstract = {From the perspective of neural coding, the considerable trial-to-trial variability in the responses of neurons to sensory stimuli is puzzling. Trial-to-trial response variability is typically interpreted in terms of "noise" (i.e., it represents either intrinsic noise of the system or information unrelated to the stimuli). However, trial-to-trial response variability can be considerably different across stimuli, suggesting that it could also provide an important contribution to the information conveyed by the neural responses about the stimuli. To test this hypothesis, we addressed the problem of discriminating stimulus location from the spike-count responses of neurons recorded in the ventro-postero-medial ({VPM)} nucleus of the thalamus in anesthetized rats. Using a recently developed information theory approach, we verified that differences between stimuli in the trial-to-trial spike-count variability of the responses provided an important contribution to the overall information carried by the neurons. In addition, we found that the relatively reliable (sub-Poisson) firing regime of our {VPM} neurons was not only more informative, but also more redundant between neurons compared with a more variable (Poisson) firing regime with the same total number of spikes. The typical increase in trial-to-trial response variability from the periphery to the cortex could therefore serve as a strategy to reduce redundancy between neurons and promote efficient sparse coding distributed in large populations of neurons. Overall, our data suggest that the trial-to-trial response variability plays a critical role in establishing the trade-off between total information and redundancy between neurons in population codes.},

To constrain and test computational models, researchers need access to a wide variety of experimental data. Much of those data are not readily accessible because neuroscientists fall into separate communities that study the brain at different levels and have not been motivated to provide data to researchers outside their community. To foster sharing of neuroscience data, a workshop was held in 2007, bringing together experimental and theoretical neuroscientists, computer scientists, legal experts and governmental observers. Computational neuroscience was recommended as an ideal field for focusing data sharing, and specific methods, strategies and policies were suggested for achieving it. A new funding area in the {NSF/NIH} Collaborative Research in Computational Neuroscience ({CRCNS)} program has been established to support data sharing, guided in part by the workshop recommendations. The new funding area is dedicated to the dissemination of high quality data sets with maximum scientific value for computational neuroscience. The first round of the {CRCNS} data sharing program supports the preparation of data sets which will be publicly available in 2008. These include electrophysiology and behavioral (eye movement) data described towards the end of this article.},

	abstract = {Olfactory systems encode odours by which neurons respond and by when they respond. In mammals, every sniff evokes a precise, odour-specific sequence of activity across olfactory neurons. Likewise, in a variety of neural systems, ranging from sensory periphery to cognitive centres, neuronal activity is timed relative to sampling behaviour and/or internally generated oscillations. As in these neural systems, relative timing of activity may represent information in the olfactory system. However, there is no evidence that mammalian olfactory systems read such cues. To test whether mice perceive the timing of olfactory activation relative to the sniff cycle ('sniff phase'), we used optogenetics in gene-targeted mice to generate spatially constant, temporally controllable olfactory input. Here we show that mice can behaviourally report the sniff phase of optogenetically driven activation of olfactory sensory neurons. Furthermore, mice can discriminate between light-evoked inputs that are shifted in the sniff cycle by as little as 10 milliseconds, which is similar to the temporal precision of olfactory bulb odour responses. Electrophysiological recordings in the olfactory bulb of awake mice show that individual cells encode the timing of photoactivation in relation to the sniff in both the timing and the amplitude of their responses. Our work provides evidence that the mammalian olfactory system can read temporal patterns, and suggests that timing of activity relative to sampling behaviour is a potent cue that may enable accurate olfactory percepts to form quickly.},

This format is useful for several reasons: (1) it is highly distilled, with minimal data size and complexity, (2) graph theory can be applied to characterize the network's topology, and (3) it retains sufficient information to capture individual differences such as age, gender, intelligence quotient ({IQ)}, or disease state. Here we introduce the {UCLA} Multimodal Connectivity Database (http://umcd.humanconnectomeproject.org), an openly available website for brain network analysis and data sharing. The site is a repository for researchers to publicly share {CMs} derived from their data. The site also allows users to select any {CM} shared by another user, compute graph theoretical metrics on the site, visualize a report of results, or download the raw {CM.} To date, users have contributed over 2000 individual {CMs}, spanning different imaging modalities ({fMRI}, {dwMRI)} and disorders (Alzheimer's, autism, Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder). To demonstrate the site's functionality, whole brain functional and structural connectivity matrices are derived from 60 subjects' (ages 26–45) resting state {fMRI} (rs-{fMRI)} and {dwMRI} data and uploaded to the site. The site is utilized to derive graph theory global and regional measures for the rs-{fMRI} and {dwMRI} networks. Global and nodal graph theoretical measures between functional and structural networks exhibit low correspondence. This example demonstrates how this tool can enhance the comparability of brain networks from different imaging modalities and studies. The existence of this connectivity-based repository should foster broader data sharing and enable larger-scale meta-analyses comparing networks across imaging modality, age group, and disease state.},

hundreds of primate neuroanatomy facts into a single interactive visualization. The resulting

memory selection, behavioral memory output, cognitive control, and cortical information 
flow regulation. Each circuit is described in terms of distinguishable neuronal groups including the
cerebral isocortex (9 pyramidal neuronal groups), parahippocampal gyrus and hippocampus,
thalamus (4 neuronal groups), basal ganglia (7 neuronal groups), metencephalon, basal forebrain
and other subcortical nuclei. We focus on neuroanatomy related to primate non-primary cortical

Here we show that two major interneuron circuits govern dynamic inhibition in space and time within the olfactory cortex. Dendritic-targeting layer 1 interneurons receive strong input from the olfactory bulb and govern early-onset feedforward inhibition. However, this circuit is only transiently engaged during bursts of olfactory bulb input. In contrast, somatic-targeting layer 3 interneurons, recruited exclusively by recurrent excitation from pyramidal cells, produce late-onset feedback inhibition. Our results reveal two complementary interneuron circuits enforcing widespread inhibition, which shifts from the apical dendrites to somata of pyramidal cells during bursts of sensory input.},

This low amplification is in contrast to rod phototransduction in vision, the best-quantified G-protein signaling pathway, where each photoisomerized rhodopsin molecule is well known to produce substantial amplification by activating many G-protein, and hence effector-enzyme, molecules. We have now carried out similar experiments on mouse {ORNs}, which offer, additionally, the advantage of genetics. Indeed, we found the same low probability of transduction, based on the unitary olfactory response having a fairly constant amplitude and similar kinetics across different odorants and randomly encountered {ORNs.} Also, consistent with our picture, the unitary response of Gαolf+/− {ORNs} was similar to {WT} in amplitude, although their Gαolf-protein expression was only half of normal. Finally, from the action potential firing, we estimated that ≤19 odorant-binding events successfully triggering transduction in a {WT} mouse {ORN} will lead to signaling to the brain.},

	abstract = {Avian nucleus magnocellularis ({NM)} spikes provide a temporal code representing sound arrival times to downstream neurons that compute sound source location. {NM} cells act as high-pass filters by responding only to discrete synaptic events while ignoring temporally summed {EPSPs.} This high degree of input selectivity insures that each output spike from {NM} unambiguously represents inputs that contain precise temporal information. However, we lack a quantitative description of the computation performed by {NM} cells. A powerful model for predicting output firing rate given an arbitrary current input is given by a linear/nonlinear cascade: the stimulus is compared with a known relevant feature by linear filtering, and based on that comparison, a nonlinear function predicts the firing response. Spike-triggered covariance analysis allows us to determine a generalization of this model in which firing depends on more than one spike-triggering feature or stimulus dimension. We found two current features relevant for {NM} spike generation; the most important simply smooths the current on short time scales, whereas the second confers sensitivity to rapid changes. A model based on these two features captured more mutual information between current and spikes than a model based on a single feature. We used this analysis to characterize the changes in the computation brought about by pharmacological manipulation of the biophysical properties of the neurons. Blockage of low-threshold voltage-gated potassium channels selectively eliminated the requirement for the second stimulus feature, generalizing our understanding of input selectivity by {NM} cells. This study demonstrates the power of covariance analysis for investigating single neuron computation.},

	abstract = {The subject of neural coding has generated much debate. A key issue is whether the nervous system uses coarse or fine coding. Each has different strengths and weaknesses and, therefore, different implications for how the brain computes. For example, the strength of coarse coding is that it is robust to fluctuations in spike arrival times; downstream neurons do not have to keep track of the details of the spike train. The weakness, though, is that individual cells cannot carry much information, so downstream neurons have to pool signals across cells and/or time to obtain enough information to represent the sensory world and guide behavior. In contrast, with fine coding, individual cells can carry much more information, but downstream neurons have to resolve spike train structure to obtain it. Here, we set up a strategy to determine which codes are viable, and we apply it to the retina as a model system. We recorded from all the retinal output cells an animal uses to solve a task, evaluated the cells' spike trains for as long as the animal evaluates them, and used optimal, i.e., Bayesian, decoding. This approach makes it possible to obtain an upper bound on the performance of codes and thus eliminate those that are insufficient, that is, those that cannot account for behavioral performance. Our results show that standard coarse coding (spike count coding) is insufficient; finer, more information-rich codes are necessary.},

The foundation of the approach is the construction of several families of novel distances (metrics) between neuronal impulse trains. In contrast to most previous approaches to the analysis of temporal coding, the present approach does not attempt to embed impulse trains in a vector space, and does not assume a Euclidean notion of distance. Rather, the proposed metrics formalize physiologically based hypotheses for those aspects of the firing pattern that might be stimulus dependent, and make essential use of the point-process nature of neural discharges. We show that these families of metrics endow the space of impulse trains with related but inequivalent topological structures. We demonstrate how these metrics can be used to determine whether a set of observed responses has a stimulus-dependent temporal structure without a vector-space embedding. We show how multidimensional scaling can be used to assess the similarit...}

	abstract = {Selective attention is a fundamental cognitive function that uses top-down signals to orient and prioritize information processing in the brain. Single-cell recordings from behaving monkeys have revealed a number of attention-induced effects on sensory neurons, and have given rise to contrasting viewpoints about the neural underpinning of attentive processing. Moreover, there is evidence that attentional signals originate from the prefrontoparietal working memory network, but precisely how a source area of attention interacts with a sensory system remains unclear. To address these questions, we investigated a biophysically based network model of spiking neurons composed of a reciprocally connected loop of two (sensory and working memory) networks. We found that a wide variety of physiological phenomena induced by selective attention arise naturally in such a system. In particular, our work demonstrates a neural circuit that instantiates the “feature-similarity gain modulation principle,” according to which the attentional gain effect on sensory neuronal responses is a graded function of the difference between the attended feature and the preferred feature of the neuron, independent of the stimulus. Furthermore, our model identifies key circuit mechanisms that underlie feature-similarity gain modulation, multiplicative scaling of tuning curve, and biased competition, and provide specific testable predictions. These results offer a synthetic account of the diverse attentional effects, suggesting a canonical neural circuit for feature-based attentional processing in the cortex.},

Information theory is one such tool, and has been utilized extensively in the study of the neural code. Although much progress has been made in information theoretic methodology, there is still no satisfying answer to the question: {“What} is the information that a given property of the neural population activity (e.g., the responses of single cells within the population) carries about a set of stimuli?” Here, we answer such questions via the minimum mutual information ({MinMI)} principle. We quantify the information in any statistical property of the neural response by considering all hypothetical neuronal populations that have the given property and finding the one that contains the minimum information about the stimuli. All systems with higher information values necessarily contain additional information processing mechanisms and, thus, the minimum captures the information related to the given property alone. {MinMI} may be used to measure information in properties of the neural response, such as that conveyed by responses of small subsets of cells (e.g., singles or pairs) in a large population and cooperative effects between subunits in networks. We show how the framework can be used to study neural coding in large populations and to reveal properties that are not discovered by other information theoretic methods.},

	abstract = {Cell-lineage-specific transcripts, i.e. those with expression restricted to a limited set of cell types, are essential for differentiated tissue function, mediate acquired chronic diseases, and are implicated in hereditary organ failure. However, experimental identification of cell-lineage specific genes in a genome-scale manner is infeasible for most solid human tissues. To address this challenge, we developed the first genome-scale computational method to identify genes with cell-lineage-specific expression, even in lineages not separable by experimental micro-dissection. Our machine learning-based approach leverages high-throughput functional-genomics data from tissue homogenates in a novel iterative statistical framework. We applied this method to chronic kidney disease and identified transcripts specific to podocytes, key cells in the glomerular filter responsible for hereditary and most acquired glomerular kidney disease. We systematically evaluated our predictions by immunohistochemistry, verifying selective tissue-distribution of podocyte-specific genes within the kidney. Our in silico approach was significantly more accurate (65\% accuracy in human) than predictions based on direct measurement of in vivo fluorescence-tagged murine podocytes (23\% accuracy in human). In agreement with the hypothesis that cell-lineage specific transcripts are likely to be associated with disease, our method identified genes implicated as causal in hereditary glomerular disease and involved in molecular pathways of acquired and chronic renal diseases. Furthermore, based on expression analysis of human kidney disease biopsy samples, we demonstrated that expression of the podocyte genes identified by our approach is significantly related to the degree of renal impairment in patients. Our approach is general and broadly applicable to define lineage specificity in both cell physiology and human disease contexts. We provide a user-friendly website that enables researchers to easily apply this method to any cell-lineage or tissue of interest (nano.princeton.edu). Identified cell-lineage specific transcripts are expected to play essential tissue-specific roles in organogenesis and disease and can provide starting points for the development of organ-specific diagnostics and therapies.},

Already Galton [Galton F (1907) Nature 75:7] found evidence that the median estimate of a group can be more accurate than estimates of experts. This wisdom of crowd effect was recently supported by examples from stock markets, political elections, and quiz shows [Surowiecki J (2004) The Wisdom of Crowds]. In contrast, we demonstrate by experimental evidence (N = 144) that even mild social influence can undermine the wisdom of crowd effect in simple estimation tasks. In the experiment, subjects could reconsider their response to factual questions after having received average or full information of the responses of other subjects. We compare subjects’ convergence of estimates and improvements in accuracy over five consecutive estimation periods with a control condition, in which no information about others’ responses was provided. Although groups are initially “wise,” knowledge about estimates of others narrows the diversity of opinions to such an extent that it undermines the wisdom of crowd effect in three different ways. The “social influence effect” diminishes the diversity of the crowd without improvements of its collective error. The “range reduction effect” moves the position of the truth to peripheral regions of the range of estimates so that the crowd becomes less reliable in providing expertise for external observers. The “confidence effect” boosts individuals’ confidence after convergence of their estimates despite lack of improved accuracy.

Odorants evoked patterns of discrete Ca signals throughout the neuropil of a glomerulus. Across glomeruli, Ca signals occurred with equal probability in all glomerular regions. Within single glomeruli, the pattern of intraglomerular Ca signals was indistinguishable for stimuli of different duration, identity, and concentration. Moreover, the response time course of the signals was similar throughout the glomerulus. Hence, sensory inputs to individual glomeruli are spatially heterogeneous but seem to be functionally indiscriminate. These results support the view of olfactory glomeruli as functional units in representing sensory information.},

	abstract = {Temporally correlated spike discharges are proposed to be important for the coding of olfactory stimuli. In the olfactory bulb, correlated spiking is known in two classes of output neurons, the mitral cells and external tufted cells. We studied a third major class of bulb output neurons, the middle tufted cells, analyzing their bursting and spike timing correlations, and their relation to mitral cells. Using patch-clamp and fluorescent tracing, we recorded spontaneous spiking from tufted-tufted or mitral-tufted cell pairs with visualized dendritic projections in mouse olfactory bulb slices. We found peaks in spike cross-correlograms indicating correlated activity on both fast (peak width 1-50 ms) and slow (peak width{\textgreater}50 ms) time scales, only in pairs with convergent glomerular projections. Coupling appeared tighter in tufted-tufted pairs, which showed correlated firing patterns and smaller mean width and lag of narrow peaks. Some narrow peaks resolved into 2-3 sub-peaks (width 1-12 ms), indicating multiple modes of fast correlation. Slow correlations were related to bursting activity, while fast correlations were independent of slow correlations, occurring in both bursting and non-bursting cells. The {AMPA} receptor antagonist {NBQX} (20 {microM)} failed to abolish broad or narrow peaks in either tufted-tufted or mitral-tufted pairs, and changes of peak height and width in {NBQX} were not significantly different from spontaneous drift. Thus, {AMPA-receptors} are not required for fast and slow spike correlations. Electrical coupling was observed in all convergent tufted-tufted and mitral-tufted pairs tested, suggesting a potential role for gap junctions in concerted firing. Glomerulus-specific correlation of spiking offers a useful mechanism for binding the output signals of diverse neurons processing and transmitting different sensory information encoded by common olfactory receptors.},

	abstract = {In systems neuroscience, neural activity that represents movements or sensory stimuli is often characterized by spatial tuning curves that may change in response to training, attention, altered mechanics, or the passage of time. A vital step in determining whether tuning curves change is accounting for estimation uncertainty due to measurement noise. In this study, we address the issue of tuning curve stability using methods that take uncertainty directly into account. We analyze data recorded from neurons in primary motor cortex using chronically implanted, multielectrode arrays in four monkeys performing center-out reaching. With the use of simulations, we demonstrate that under typical experimental conditions, the effect of neuronal noise on estimated preferred direction can be quite large and is affected by both the amount of data and the modulation depth of the neurons. In experimental data, we find that after taking uncertainty into account using bootstrapping techniques, the majority of neurons appears to be very stable on a timescale of minutes to hours. Lastly, we introduce adaptive filtering methods to explicitly model dynamic tuning curves. In contrast to several previous findings suggesting that tuning curves may be in constant flux, we conclude that the neural representation of limb movement is, on average, quite stable and that impressions to the contrary may be largely the result of measurement noise.},

However, new research has identified networks of brain areas, including the pre-supplementary motor area, the anterior prefrontal cortex and the parietal cortex, that underlie voluntary action. These areas generate information for forthcoming actions, and also cause the distinctive conscious experience of intending to act and then controlling one's own actions. Volition consists of a series of decisions regarding whether to act, what action to perform and when to perform it.

A model based on these two ingredients reproduces the observed stationary scale-free distributions, which indicates that the development of large networks is governed by robust self-organizing phenomena that go beyond the particulars of the individual systems.},

	abstract = {Stimulus reconstruction or decoding methods provide an important tool for understanding how sensory and motor information is represented in neural activity. We discuss Bayesian decoding methods based on an encoding generalized linear model ({GLM)} that accurately describes how stimuli are transformed into the spike trains of a group of neurons. The form of the {GLM} likelihood ensures that the posterior distribution over the stimuli that caused an observed set of spike trains is log concave so long as the prior is. This allows the maximum a posteriori ({MAP)} stimulus estimate to be obtained using efficient optimization algorithms. Unfortunately, the {MAP} estimate can have a relatively large average error when the posterior is highly nongaussian. Here we compare several Markov chain Monte Carlo ({MCMC)} algorithms that allow for the calculation of general Bayesian estimators involving posterior expectations (conditional on model parameters). An efficient version of the hybrid Monte Carlo ({HMC)} algorithm was significantly superior to other {MCMC} methods for gaussian priors. When the prior distribution has sharp edges and corners, on the other hand, the “hit-and-run” algorithm performed better than other {MCMC} methods. Using these algorithms, we show that for this latter class of priors, the posterior mean estimate can have a considerably lower average error than {MAP}, whereas for gaussian priors, the two estimators have roughly equal efficiency. We also address the application of {MCMC} methods for extracting nonmarginal properties of the posterior distribution. For example, by using {MCMC} to calculate the mutual information between the stimulus and response, we verify the validity of a computationally efficient Laplace approximation to this quantity for gaussian priors in a wide range of model parameters; this makes direct model-based computation of the mutual information tractable even in the case of large observed neural populations, where methods based on binning the spike train fail. Finally, we consider the effect of uncertainty in the {GLM} parameters on the posterior estimators.},

	abstract = {We consider the problem of extracting smooth, low-dimensional neural trajectories that summarize the activity recorded simultaneously from many neurons on individual experimental trials. Beyond the benefit of visualizing the high-dimensional, noisy spiking activity in a compact form, such trajectories can offer insight into the dynamics of the neural circuitry underlying the recorded activity. Current methods for extracting neural trajectories involve a two-stage process: the spike trains are first smoothed over time, then a static dimensionality-reduction technique is applied. We first describe extensions of the two-stage methods that allow the degree of smoothing to be chosen in a principled way and that account for spiking variability, which may vary both across neurons and across time. We then present a novel method for extracting neural trajectories-Gaussian-process factor analysis ({GPFA)-which} unifies the smoothing and dimensionality-reduction operations in a common probabilistic framework. We applied these methods to the activity of 61 neurons recorded simultaneously in macaque premotor and motor cortices during reach planning and execution. By adopting a goodness-of-fit metric that measures how well the activity of each neuron can be predicted by all other recorded neurons, we found that the proposed extensions improved the predictive ability of the two-stage methods. The predictive ability was further improved by going to {GPFA.} From the extracted trajectories, we directly observed a convergence in neural state during motor planning, an effect that was shown indirectly by previous studies. We then show how such methods can be a powerful tool for relating the spiking activity across a neural population to the subject's behavior on a single-trial basis. Finally, to assess how well the proposed methods characterize neural population activity when the underlying time course is known, we performed simulations that revealed that {GPFA} performed tens of percent better than the best two-stage method.},

The issue, in other words, is whether they have established new principles about how the brain works. In this paper we offer as an example one new principle, partly to lay down the criteria that are required for establishing a new principle, and partly to encourage others to offer other principles. Our example concerns the flexible flow of information through the cortex that must occur according to the demands of the task or current context. We suggest that this flexibility is achieved by feedback connections from the prefrontal and parietal cortex, and that these include connections to sensory and motor areas. However, the nature of the selective effect differs. The parietal cortex can select both within and across processing streams. By across streams we mean that it can have the same influence on different streams, for example the dorsal and ventral visual systems. However, only the prefrontal cortex can also select between processing streams. The difference between the prefrontal and parietal effects is due to their different positions within the processing hierarchy.},

	abstract = {Most neurons in visual cortex respond to contrast borders and are orientation selective, and some are also selective for which side of a border is figure and which side is ground ("border ownership coding"). These neurons are influenced by the image context far beyond the classical receptive field ({CRF)} and as early as 25 ms after the onset of activity in the cortex. The nature of the fast context integration mechanism is not well understood. What parts of a figure contribute to the context effect? What is the structure of the "extraclassical surround"? Is the context information propagated through horizontal fibers within cortex or through reciprocal connections via higher-level areas? To address these questions, we studied border ownership modulation with fragmented figures. Neurons were recorded in areas V1 and V2 of Macaca mulatta under behaviorally induced fixation. Test figures were fragmented rectangles. While one edge was centered on the {CRF}, the presence of the fragments outside the {CRF} was varied. The surround fragments produced facilitation on the preferred border ownership side as well as suppression on the nonpreferred side, with [{\textasciitilde}]80\% of the locations contributing on average. Fragments far from the {CRF} influenced the responses even in the absence of fragments closer to the {CRF}, and without the extra delay that would incur from propagation through horizontal fibers. Three principally different models are discussed. The results support a model in which the antagonistic surround influences are produced by reentrant signals from a higher-level area.},

	abstract = {Sensory encoding in spiking neurons depends on both the integration of sensory inputs and the intrinsic dynamics and variability of spike generation. We show that the stimulus selectivity, reliability, and timing precision of primate retinal ganglion cell ({RGC)} light responses can be reproduced accurately with a simple model consisting of a leaky integrate-and-fire spike generator driven by a linearly filtered stimulus, a postspike current, and a Gaussian noise current. We fit model parameters for individual {RGCs} by maximizing the likelihood of observed spike responses to a stochastic visual stimulus. Although compact, the fitted model predicts the detailed time structure of responses to novel stimuli, accurately capturing the interaction between the spiking history and sensory stimulus selectivity. The model also accounts for the variability in responses to repeated stimuli, even when fit to data from a single (nonrepeating) stimulus sequence. Finally, the model can be used to derive an explicit, maximum-likelihood decoding rule for neural spike trains, thus providing a tool for assessing the limitations that spiking variability imposes on sensory performance.},

	abstract = {Spike trains commonly exhibit interspike interval ({ISI)} correlations caused by spike-activated adaptation currents. Here we investigate how the dynamics of adaptation currents can represent spike pattern information generated from stimulus inputs. By analyzing dynamical models of stimulus-driven single neurons, we show that the activation states of the correlation-inducing adaptation current are themselves statistically independent from spike to spike. This paradoxical finding suggests a biophysically plausible means of information representation. We show that adaptation independence is elicited by input levels that produce regular, non-Poisson spiking. This adaptation-independent regime is advantageous for sensory processing because it does not require sensory inferences on the basis of multivariate conditional probabilities, reducing the computational cost of decoding. Furthermore, if the kinetics of postsynaptic activation are similar to the adaptation, the activation state information can be communicated postsynaptically with no information loss, leading to an experimental prediction that simple synaptic kinetics can decorrelate the correlated {ISI} sequence. The adaptation-independence regime may underly efficient weak signal detection by sensory afferents that are known to exhibit intrinsic correlated spiking, thus efficiently encoding stimulus information at the limit of physical resolution.},

	abstract = {All visual signals the cortex receives are influenced by the perigeniculate sector ({PGN)} of the thalamic reticular nucleus, which receives input from relay cells in the lateral geniculate and provides feedback inhibition in return. Relay cells have been studied in quantitative depth; they behave in a roughly linear fashion and have receptive fields with a stereotyped center-surround structure. We know far less about reticular neurons. Qualitative studies indicate they simply pool ascending input to generate non-selective gain control. Yet the perigeniculate is complicated; local cells are densely interconnected and fire lengthy bursts. Thus, we employed quantitative methods to explore the perigeniculate using relay cells as controls. By adapting methods of spike-triggered averaging and covariance analysis for bursts, we identified both first and second order features that build reticular receptive fields. The shapes of these spatiotemporal subunits varied widely; no stereotyped pattern emerged. Companion experiments showed that the shape of the first but not second order features could be explained by the overlap of On and Off inputs to a given cell. Moreover, we assessed the predictive power of the receptive field and how much information each component subunit conveyed. Linear-non-linear ({LN)} models including multiple subunits performed better than those made with just one; further each subunit encoded different visual information. Model performance for reticular cells was always lesser than for relay cells, however, indicating that reticular cells process inputs non-linearly. All told, our results suggest that the perigeniculate encodes diverse visual features to selectively modulate activity transmitted downstream.},

	abstract = {1. Intracellular recordings were obtained from neurons of the guinea pig sensorimotor cortical slice maintained in vitro. Under control recording conditions input resistances, time constants, and spiking characteristics of slice neurons were well within the ranges reported by other investigators for neocortical neurons in situ. However, resting potentials (mean of -75 {mV)} and spike amplitudes (mean of 93.5 {mV)} were 10-25 {mV} greater than has been observed in intact preparations. 2. Current-voltage relationships obtained under current clamp revealed a spectrum of membrane-rectifying properties at potentials that were subthreshold for spike generation. Ionic and pharmacologic analyses suggest that subthreshold membrane behavior is dominated by voltage-sensitive, very slowly inactivating conductances to K+ and Na+. 3. Action potentials were predominantly Na+ dependent under normal conditions but when outward K+ currents were reduced pharmacologically, it was possible, in most cells, to evoke a non-Na+-dependent, tetrodotoxin-({TTX)} insensitive spike, which was followed by a prominent depolarizing after-potential. Both of these events were blocked by the Ca2+ current antagonists, Co2+ and Mn2+. 4. A small population of neurons generated intrinsic, all-or-none burst potentials when depolarized with current pulses or by synaptic activation. These cells were located at a narrow range of depths comprising layer {IV} and the more superficial parts of layer V. 5. Spontaneous excitatory synaptic potentials appeared in all neurons. Spontaneous inhibitory events were visible in only about 10\% of the cells, and in those cases apparently reversed polarity at a level slightly positive to resting potential. Stimulation of the surface of the slice at low intensities evoked robust and usually concurrent excitatory and inhibitory synaptic potentials. Unitary inhibitory postsynaptic potentials ({IPSPs)} reversed at levels positive to rest. Stronger stimulation produced a labile, long-duration, hyperpolarizing {IPSP} with a reversal potential 15-20 {mV} negative to the resting level. 6. Neocortical neurons in vitro retain the basic membrane and synaptic properties ascribed to them in situ. However, the array of passive and active membrane behavior observed in the slice suggests that cortical neurons may be differentiated by specific functional properties as well as by their extensive morphological diversity.},

Here we adopt an approach based on models that describe how a stimulating agent (such as an injected electrical current or a laser light interacting with caged neurotransmitters or photosensitive ion channels) affects the spiking activity of neurons. Based on these models, we solve the reverse problem of finding the best time-dependent modulation of the input, subject to hardware limitations as well as physiologically inspired safety measures, that causes the neuron to emit a spike train that with highest probability will be close to a target spike train. We adopt fast convex constrained optimization methods to solve this problem. Our methods can potentially be implemented in real time and may also be generalized to the case of many cells, suitable for neural prosthesis applications. With the use of biologically sensible parameters and constraints, our method finds stimulation patterns that generate very precise spike trains in simulated experiments. We also tested the intracellular current injection method on pyramidal cells in mouse cortical slices, quantifying the dependence of spiking reliability and timing precision on constraints imposed on the applied currents.},

	abstract = {Adaptively optimizing experiments has the potential to significantly reduce the number of trials needed to build parametric statistical models of neural systems. However, application of adaptive methods to neurophysiology has been limited by severe computational challenges. Since most neurons are high-dimensional systems, optimizing neurophysiology experiments requires computing high-dimensional integrations and optimizations in real time. Here we present a fast algorithm for choosing the most informative stimulus by maximizing the mutual information between the data and the unknown parameters of a generalized linear model ({GLM)} that we want to fit to the neuron's activity. We rely on important log concavity and asymptotic normality properties of the posterior to facilitate the required computations. Our algorithm requires only low-rank matrix manipulations and a two-dimensional search to choose the optimal stimulus. The average running time of these operations scales quadratically with the dimensionality of the {GLM}, making real-time adaptive experimental design feasible even for high-dimensional stimulus and parameter spaces. For example, we require roughly 10 milliseconds on a desktop computer to optimize a 100-dimensional stimulus. Despite using some approximations to make the algorithm efficient, our algorithm asymptotically decreases the uncertainty about the model parameters at a rate equal to the maximum rate predicted by an asymptotic analysis. Simulation results show that picking stimuli by maximizing the mutual information can speed up convergence to the optimal values of the parameters by an order of magnitude compared to using random (nonadaptive) stimuli. Finally, applying our design procedure to real neurophysiology experiments requires addressing the nonstationarities that we would expect to see in neural responses; our algorithm can efficiently handle both fast adaptation due to spike history effects and slow, nonsystematic drifts in a neuron's activity.},

	abstract = {To gain a deeper understanding of the transmission of visual signals from retina through the lateral geniculate nucleus ({LGN)}, we have used a simple leaky integrate and-fire model to simulate a relay cell in the {LGN.} The simplicity of the model was motivated by two questions: (1) Can an {LGN} model that is driven by a retinal spike train recorded as synaptic ({'S')} potentials, but does not include a diverse array of ion channels, nor feedback inputs from the cortex, brainstem, and thalamic reticular nucleus, accurately simulate the {LGN} discharge on a spike-for-spike basis? (2) Are any special synaptic mechanisms, beyond simple summation of currents, necessary to model experimental recordings? We recorded cat relay cell responses to spatially homogeneous small or large spots, with luminance that was rapidly modulated in a pseudo-random fashion. Model parameters for each cell were optimized with a Simplex algorithm using a short segment of the recording. The model was then tested on a much longer, distinct data set consisting of responses to numerous repetitions of the noisy stimulus. For {LGN} cells that spiked in response to a sufficiently large fraction of retinal inputs, we found that this simplified model accurately predicted the firing times of {LGN} discharges. This suggests that modulations of the efficacy of the retino-geniculate synapse by pre-synaptic facilitation or depression are not necessary in order to account for the {LGN} responses generated by our stimuli, and that post-synaptic summation is sufficient.},

The recent advent of recording techniques such as multielectrode arrays and two-photon imaging has made it easier to measure correlations, opening the door for detailed exploration of their properties and contributions to cortical processing. However, studies have reported discrepant findings, providing a confusing picture. Here we briefly review these studies and conduct simulations to explore the influence of several experimental and physiological factors on correlation measurements. Differences in response strength, the time window over which spikes are counted, spike sorting conventions and internal states can all markedly affect measured correlations and systematically bias estimates. Given these complicating factors, we offer guidelines for interpreting correlation data and a discussion of how best to evaluate the effect of correlations on cortical processing.

	abstract = {Mitral cells of the olfactory bulb form sparse representations of the odorants and transmit this information to the cortex. The olfactory code carried by the mitral cells is sparser than the inputs that they receive. In this study we analyze the mechanisms and functional significance of sparse olfactory codes. We consider a model of olfactory bulb containing populations of excitatory mitral and inhibitory granule cells. We argue that sparse codes may emerge as a result of self organization in the network leading to the precise balance between mitral cells' excitatory inputs and inhibition provided by the granule cells. We propose a novel role for the olfactory granule cells. We show that these cells can build representations of odorant stimuli that are not fully accurate. Due to the incompleteness in the granule cell representation, the exact excitation-inhibition balance is established only for some mitral cells leading to sparse responses of the mitral cell. Our model suggests a functional significance to the dendrodendritic synapses that mediate interactions between mitral and granule cells. The model accounts for the sparse olfactory code in the steady state and predicts that transient dynamics may be less sparse.},

	abstract = {Many biological systems have been described as networks whose complex properties influence the behaviour of the system. Correlations of activity in such networks are of interest in a variety of fields, from gene-regulatory networks to neuroscience. Due to novel experimental techniques allowing the recording of the activity of many pairs of neurons and their importance with respect to the functional interpretation of spike data, spike train correlations in neural networks have recently attracted a considerable amount of attention. Although origin and function of these correlations is not known in detail, they are believed to have a fundamental influence on information processing and learning. We present a detailed explanation of how recurrent connectivity induces correlations in local neural networks and how structural features affect their size and distribution. We examine under which conditions network characteristics like distance dependent connectivity, hubs or patches markedly influence correlations and population signals.},

	abstract = {Linear-Nonlinear-Poisson ({LNP)} models are a popular and powerful tool for describing encoding (stimulus-response) transformations by single sensory as well as motor neurons. Recently, there has been rising interest in the second- and higher-order correlation structure of neural spike trains, and how it may be related to specific encoding relationships. The distortion of signal correlations as they are transformed through particular {LNP} models is predictable and in some cases analytically tractable and invertible. Here, we propose that {LNP} encoding models can potentially be identified strictly from the correlation transformations they induce, and develop a computational method for identifying minimum-phase single-neuron temporal kernels under white and colored random Gaussian excitation. Unlike reverse-correlation or maximum-likelihood, correlation-distortion based identification does not require the simultaneous observation of stimulus-response pairs-only their respective second order statistics. Although in principle filter kernels are not necessarily minimum-phase, and only their spectral amplitude can be uniquely determined from output correlations, we show that in practice this method provides excellent estimates of kernels from a range of parametric models of neural systems. We conclude by discussing how this approach could potentially enable neural models to be estimated from a much wider variety of experimental conditions and systems, and its limitations.},

As such, there has been a recent increase in the amount of informatics research devoted to developing digital resources for neuroscience research. Neuroinformatics is concerned with the development of computational tools to further our understanding of the brain and to make sense of the vast amount of information that neuroscientists generate (French \& Pavlidis, 2007). Many of these tools are related to the use of textual data. Here, we review some of the recent developments for better using the vast amount of textual information generated in neuroscience research and publication and suggest several use cases that will demonstrate how bench neuroscientists can take advantage of the resources that are available.},

This perceptual ability is likely subserved by auditory neurons whose spiking responses to individual vocalizations are minimally affected by background sounds. However, auditory neurons that produce background-invariant responses to vocalizations in auditory scenes have not been found. Here, we describe a population of neurons in the zebra finch auditory cortex that represent vocalizations with a sparse code and that maintain their vocalization-like firing patterns in levels of background sound that permit behavioral recognition. These same neurons decrease or stop spiking in levels of background sound that preclude behavioral recognition. In contrast, upstream neurons represent vocalizations with dense and background-corrupted responses. We provide experimental evidence suggesting that sparse coding is mediated by feedforward suppression. Finally, we show through simulations that feedforward inhibition can transform a dense representation of vocalizations into a sparse and background-invariant representation.},

Thus, they have the potential to achieve appropriate spatiotemporal resolution and the cellular-molecular specificity necessary for observing and probing the makings and inner workings of neurons and neuronal circuits. Furthermore, genetic analysis will be key to unraveling the intricate link from genes to circuits to systems, in part through systematic targeting and tracking of individual cellular components of neural circuits.

	abstract = {A key issue in understanding the neural code for an ensemble of neurons is the nature and strength of correlations between neurons and how these correlations are related to the stimulus. The issue is complicated by the fact that there is not a single notion of independence or lack of correlation. We distinguish three kinds: (1) activity independence; (2) conditional independence; and (3) information independence. Each notion is related to an information measure: the information between cells, the information between cells given the stimulus, and the synergy of cells about the stimulus, respectively. We show that these measures form an interrelated framework for evaluating contributions of signal and noise correlations to the joint information conveyed about the stimulus and that at least two of the three measures must be calculated to characterize a population code. This framework is compared with others recently proposed in the literature. In addition, we distinguish questions about how information is encoded by a population of neurons from how that information can be decoded. Although information theory is natural and powerful for questions of encoding, it is not sufficient for characterizing the process of decoding. Decoding fundamentally requires an error measure that quantifies the importance of the deviations of estimated stimuli from actual stimuli. Because there is no a priori choice of error measure, questions about decoding cannot be put on the same level of generality as for encoding.},

	abstract = {Cortical neurons recorded in vivo exhibit highly variable responses to the repeated presentation of the same stimulus. To further understand the cellular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon, we performed intracellular recordings from neurons in cat striate cortex in vivo and examined the relationships between spontaneous activity and visually evoked responses. Activity was assessed on a trial-by-trial basis by measuring the membrane potential (Vm) fluctuations and spike activity during brief epochs immediately before and after the onset of an evoked response. We found that the response magnitude, expressed as a change in Vm relative to baseline, was linearly correlated with the preceding spontaneous Vm. This correlation was enhanced when the cells were hyperpolarized to reduce the activation of voltage-gated conductances. The output of the cells, expressed as spike counts and latencies, was only moderately correlated with fluctuations in the preceding spontaneous Vm. Spike-triggered averaging of Vm revealed that visually evoked action potentials arise from transient depolarizations having a rise time of approximately 10 msec. Consistent with this, evoked spike count was found to be linearly correlated with the magnitude of Vm fluctuations in the gamma (20-70 Hz) frequency band. We also found that the threshold of visually evoked action potentials varied over a range of approximately 10 {mV.} Examination of simultaneously recorded intracellular and extracellular activity revealed a correlation between Vm depolarization and spike discharges in adjacent cells. Together these results demonstrate that response variability is attributable largely to coherent fluctuations in cortical activity preceding the onset of a stimulus, but also to variations in action potential threshold and the magnitude of high-frequency fluctuations evoked by the stimulus.},

On the other hand, much has been written about the negative effects of institutionalizing journal rank as an impact measure. So far, contributions to the debate concerning the limitations of journal rank as a scientific impact assessment tool have either lacked data, or relied on only a few studies. In this review, we present the most recent and pertinent data on the consequences of our current scholarly communication system with respect to various measures of scientific quality (such as utility/citations, methodological soundness, expert ratings or retractions). These data corroborate previous hypotheses: using journal rank as an assessment tool is bad scientific practice. Moreover, the data lead us to argue that any journal rank (not only the currently-favored Impact Factor) would have this negative impact. Therefore, we suggest that abandoning journals altogether, in favor of a library-based scholarly communication system, will ultimately be necessary. This new system will use modern information technology to vastly improve the filter, sort and discovery functions of the current journal system.},

This diversity originates partly from the large number of genes coding for K+ channel principal subunits, but also from other processes such as alternative splicing, generating multiple {mRNA} transcripts from a single gene, heteromeric assembly of different principal subunits, as well as possible {RNA} editing and posttranslational modifications. In this chapter, we attempt to give an overview (mostly in tabular format) of the different genes coding for K+ channel principal and accessory subunits and their genealogical relationships. We discuss the possible correlation of different principal subunits with native K+ channels, the biophysical and pharmacological properties of channels formed when principal subunits are expressed in heterologous expression systems, and their patterns of tissue expression. In addition, we devote a section to describing how diversity of K+ channels can be conferred by heteromultimer formation, accessory subunits, alternative splicing, {RNA} editing and posttranslational modifications. We trust that this collection of facts will be of use to those attempting to compare the properties of new subunits to the properties of others already known or to those interested in a comparison between native channels and cloned candidates.},

Neurotransmitters are a very important component of {SCN} function. Thorough knowledge of neurotransmitters is not only essential for the understanding of the clock but also for the successful manipulation of the clock with experimental chemicals and therapeutical drugs. This article reviews the current knowledge about neurotransmitters in the {SCN}, including neurotransmitters that have been identified only recently. An attempt was made to describe the neurotransmitters and hormonal/diffusible signals of the {SCN} efference, which are necessary for the master clock to exert its overt function. The expression of robust circadian rhythms depends on the integrity of the biological clock and on the integration of thousands of individual cellular clocks found in the clock. Neurotransmitters are required at all levels, at the input, in the clock itself, and in its efferent output for the normal function of the clock. The relationship between neurotransmitter function and gene expression is also discussed because clock gene transcription forms the molecular basis of the clock and its working.},

The fundamental challenge is to decipher the “neural choreography” associated with complex behaviors and functions, including thoughts, memories, actions, and emotions. This demands the acquisition and integration of vast amounts of data of many types, at multiple scales in time and in space. Here we discuss the need for neuroinformatics approaches to accelerate progress, using several illustrative examples. The nascent field of “connectomics” aims to comprehensively describe neuronal connectivity at either a macroscopic level (in long-distance pathways for the entire brain) or a microscopic level (among axons, dendrites, and synapses in a small brain region). The Neuroscience Information Framework ({NIF)} encompasses all of neuroscience and facilitates the integration of existing knowledge and databases of many types. These examples illustrate the opportunities and challenges of data mining across multiple tiers of neuroscience information and underscore the need for cultural and infrastructure changes if neuroinformatics is to fulfill its potential to advance our understanding of the brain.},

	abstract = {1. We recorded single-unit and multi-unit activity in response to transient presentation of texture and grating patterns at 25 sites within the parafoveal representation of V1, V2, and V3 of two awake monkeys trained to perform a fixation task. In grating experiments, stimuli varied in orientation, spatial frequency, or both. In texture experiments, stimuli varied in contrast, check size, texture type, or pairs of these attributes. 2. To examine the nature and precision of temporal coding, we compared individual responses elicited by each set of stimuli in terms of two families of metrics. One family of metrics, D(spike), was sensitive to the absolute spike time (following stimulus onset). The second family of metrics, D(interval), was sensitive to the pattern of interspike intervals. In each family, the metrics depend on a parameter q, which expresses the precision of temporal coding. For q = 0, both metrics collapse into the "spike count" metric D(Count), which is sensitive to the number of impulses but insensitive to their position in time. 3. Each of these metrics, with values of q ranging from 0 to 512/s, was used to calculate the distance between all pairs of spike trains within each dataset. The extent of stimulus-specific clustering manifest in these pairwise distances was quantified by an information measure. Chance clustering was estimated by applying the same procedure to synthetic data sets in which responses were assigned randomly to the input stimuli. 4. Of the 352 data sets, 170 showed evidence of tuning via the spike count (q = 0) metric, 294 showed evidence of tuning via the spike time metric, 272 showed evidence of tuning via the spike interval metric to the stimulus attribute (contrast, check size, orientation, spatial frequency, or texture type) under study. Across the entire dataset, the information not attributable to chance clustering averaged 0.042 bits for the spike count metric, 0.171 bits for the optimal spike time metric, and 0.107 bits for the optimal spike interval metric. 5. The reciprocal of the optimal cost q serves as a measure of the temporal precision of temporal coding. In V1 and V2, with both metrics, temporal precision was highest for contrast (ca. 10-30 ms) and lowest for texture type (ca. 100 ms). This systematic dependence of q on stimulus attribute provides a possible mechanism for the simultaneous representation of multiple stimulus attributes in one spike train. 6. Our findings are inconsistent with Poisson models of spike trains. Synthetic data sets in which firing rate was governed by a time-dependent Poisson process matched to the observed poststimulus time histogram ({PSTH)} overestimated clustering induced by D(count) and, for low values of q, D(spike)[q] and D(intervals)[q]. Synthetic data sets constructed from a modified Poisson process, which preserved not only the {PSTH} but also spike count statistics accounted for the clustering induced by D(count) but underestimated the clustering induced by D(spike)[q] and D(interval)[q].},

Can we read the neural code? Although this seemingly simple question has helped us shed light on the neural code, we still do not understand the anatomical and neurophysiological constraints that enable these codes to propagate across synapses and form the basis for computations that we need to interact with our environment. The sensitivity of neuronal activity to the timing of synaptic inputs naturally suggests that synchrony determines the form of the neural code, and, in turn, regulation of synchrony is a critical element in 'writing' the neural code through the artificial control of microcircuits to activate downstream structures. In this way, reading and writing the neural code are inextricably linked.},

	abstract = {Decision-making often requires the accumulation and maintenance of evidence over time. Although the neural signals underlying sensory processing have been studied extensively, little is known about how the brain accrues and holds these sensory signals to guide later actions. Previous work has suggested that neural activity in the lateral intraparietal area ({LIP)} of the monkey brain reflects the formation of perceptual decisions in a random dot direction-discrimination task in which monkeys communicate their decisions with eye-movement responses. We tested the hypothesis that decision-related neural activity in {LIP} represents the time integral of the momentary motion "evidence." By briefly perturbing the strength of the visual motion stimulus during the formation of perceptual decisions, we tested whether this {LIP} activity reflected a persistent, integrated "memory" of these brief sensory events. We found that the responses of {LIP} neurons reflected substantial temporal integration. Brief pulses had persistent effects on both the monkeys' choices and the responses of neurons in {LIP}, lasting up to 800 ms after appearance. These results demonstrate that {LIP} is involved in neural time integration underlying the accumulation of evidence in this task. Additional analyses suggest that decision-related {LIP} responses, as well as behavioral choices and reaction times, can be explained by near-perfect time integration that stops when a criterion amount of evidence has been accumulated. Temporal integration may be a fundamental computation underlying higher cognitive functions that are dissociated from immediate sensory inputs or motor outputs.},

	abstract = {1. Those features of a transmembrane current correlated with spike initiation were examined in Aplysia neurones using a Gaussian white-noise stimulus. This stimulus has the advantages that it presents numerous wave forms in random order without prejudgement as to their efficacies, and that it allows straightforward statistical calculations. 2. Stimulation with a repeating segment of Gaussian white-noise current revealed remarkable invariance in the firing times of the tested neurones and indicated a high degree of reliability of their response. 3. Frequencies (less than 5 Hz) involved in spike triggering propagated faithfully for up to several millimetres, justifying intrasomatic current injection to examine spike initiation at the trigger locus. 4. Examination of current wave forms preceding spikes indicated that a wide variety could be effective. Hence, a statistical analysis was performed, including computation of probability densities, averages, standard deviations and correlation coefficients of pairs of current values. Each statistic was displayed as a function of time before the spike. 5. The average current trajectory preceding a spike was multiphasic and depended on the presence and polarity of a d.c. bias. An early relatively small inward- or outward-going phase was followed by a large outward phase before the spike. The early phase tended to oppose the polarity of the d.c. bias. 6. The late outward phase of the average current trajectory reached a maximum 40--75 msec before triggering the action potential ({AP)} and returned to near zero values at the moment of triggering. The fact that the current peak occurs in advance of the {AP} may be partially explained by a phase delay between the transmembrane current and potential. The failure of the average current trajectory to return to control values immediately following the peak argues for a positive role of the declining phase in spike triggering. 7. Probability densities preceding spikes were Gaussian, indicating that the average was also the most probable value. Although the densities were broad, confirming that spikes were preceded by a wide variety of current wave forms, their standard deviations were reduced significantly with respect to controls, suggesting preferred status of the average current trajectory in spike triggering. 8. The matrix of correlation coefficients between current pairs suggested that spikes tended to be preceded by wave forms that in part kept close to the average current trajectory and in part preserved its shape. 9. The average first and second derivatives of spike-evoking epochs revealed that current slope and acceleration, respectively, were most crucial in the last 200 msec before spike triggering, and that these dynamic stimulus components were more important for a cell maintained under a depolarizing, rather than a hyperpolarizing bias. 10...},

	abstract = {Stimulus reconstruction or decoding methods provide an important tool for understanding how sensory and motor information is represented in neural activity. We discuss Bayesian decoding methods based on an encoding generalized linear model ({GLM)} that accurately describes how stimuli are transformed into the spike trains of a group of neurons. The form of the {GLM} likelihood ensures that the posterior distribution over the stimuli that caused an observed set of spike trains is log concave so long as the prior is. This allows the maximum a posteriori ({MAP)} stimulus estimate to be obtained using efficient optimization algorithms. Unfortunately, the {MAP} estimate can have a relatively large average error when the posterior is highly nongaussian. Here we compare several Markov chain Monte Carlo ({MCMC)} algorithms that allow for the calculation of general Bayesian estimators involving posterior expectations (conditional on model parameters). An efficient version of the hybrid Monte Carlo ({HMC)} algorithm was significantly superior to other {MCMC} methods for gaussian priors. When the prior distribution has sharp edges and corners, on the other hand, the “hit-and-run” algorithm performed better than other {MCMC} methods. Using these algorithms, we show that for this latter class of priors, the posterior mean estimate can have a considerably lower average error than {MAP}, whereas for gaussian priors, the two estimators have roughly equal efficiency. We also address the application of {MCMC} methods for extracting nonmarginal properties of the posterior distribution. For example, by using {MCMC} to calculate the mutual information between the stimulus and response, we verify the validity of a computationally efficient Laplace approximation to this quantity for gaussian priors in a wide range of model parameters; this makes direct model-based computation of the mutual information tractable even in the case of large observed neural populations, where methods based on binning the spike train fail. Finally, we consider the effect of uncertainty in the {GLM} parameters on the posterior estimators.},

We asked how well identification of neurons by conventional measures of intrinsic excitability compares with a measure of neuronal excitability derived from a neuron’s behavior in a dynamic clamp constructed two-cell network. We used four cell types from the crab stomatogastric ganglion: the pyloric dilator, lateral pyloric, gastric mill, and dorsal gastric neurons. Each neuron was evaluated for six conventional measures of intrinsic excitability (intrinsic properties, {IPs).} Additionally, each neuron was coupled by reciprocal inhibitory synapses made with the dynamic clamp to a {Morris–Lecar} model neuron and the resulting network was assayed for four measures of network activity (network activity properties, {NAPs).} We searched for linear combinations of {IPs} that correlated with each {NAP}, and combinations of {NAPs} that correlated with each {IP.} In the process we developed a method to correct for multiple correlations while searching for correlating features. When properly controlled for multiple correlations, four of the {IPs} were correlated with {NAPs}, and all four {NAPs} were correlated with {IPs.} Neurons were classified into cell types by training a linear classifier on sets of properties, or using k-medoids clustering. The {IPs} were modestly successful in classifying the neurons, and the {NAPs} were more successful. Combining the two measures did better than either measure alone, but not well enough to classify neurons with perfect accuracy, thus reiterating that electrophysiological measures of single-cell properties alone are not sufficient for reliable cell identification.},

Neural probability functions prepared either by computing the probability of criterion response or by integrating receiver operating characteristics to yield the probability of correct choice in a two-alternative forced-choice situation resemble psychometric functions obtained in psychophysical and behavioral experiments on humans and animals, but are shallower in slope. The slopes of neuronal probability functions are slightly higher when they are estimated over short time periods, but even so do not equal the slopes measured psychophysically in human and monkey observers.

Previously, we have shown that these receptive field properties may be accounted for in terms of a strategy for producing a sparse distribution of output activity in response to natural images. Here, in addition to describing this work in a more expansive fashion, we examine the neurobiological implications of sparse coding. Of particular interest is the case when the code is overcomplete--i.e., when the number of code elements is greater than the effective dimensionality of the input space. Because the basis functions are non-orthogonal and not linearly independent of each other, sparsifying the code will recruit only those basis functions necessary for representing a given input, and so the input-output function will deviate from being purely linear. These deviations from linearity provide a potential explanation for the weak forms of non-linearity observed in the response properties of cortical simple cells, and they further make predictions about the expected interactions among units in response to naturalistic stimuli.},

Three types of neurons were identified according to their intrinsic electrophysiological properties. 2. Type I neurons (59\%) were silent at the resting membrane level (-65 +/- 10 {mV}, mean +/- {SD)} and generated a burst of spikes, with strong accommodation, to depolarizing current injection. Calcium-dependent low-frequency (1-8 Hz) membrane oscillations were often elicited by membrane depolarization (-53 +/- 8 {mV).} A low-threshold calcium conductance and an A-current were also identified. The mean input resistance of this neuronal type was 70 +/- 22 M omega. 3. Type {II} neurons (37\%) fired spontaneously at the resting membrane level (-59 +/- 9 {mV).} Their repetitive firing ({\textless} or = 200 Hz) was very sensitive to the amplitude of injected current and showed weak accommodation. Sodium-dependent high-frequency (20-100 Hz) subthreshold membrane oscillations were often elicited by membrane depolarization. This neuronal type demonstrated a low-threshold calcium spike and had the highest input resistance (134 +/- 62 M omega) of the three neuron types. 4. Type {III} neurons (4\%) did not fire spontaneously at the resting membrane level (-73 +/- 5 {mV).} Their action potentials were characterized by a long duration (2.3 +/- 0.6 ms). Repetitive firing elicited by depolarizing current injection showed weak or no accommodation. This neuronal type had an A-current and showed the lowest input resistance (52 +/- 35 M omega) of the three neuron types. 5. Stimulation of the caudoputamen evoked inhibitory postsynaptic potentials ({IPSPs)} in Type I and {II} neurons. In Type {II} neurons the {IPSPs} were usually followed by rebound firing. Excitatory postsynaptic potentials and antidromic responses were also elicited in some Type I and {II} neurons. The estimated conduction velocity of the striopallidal projection was {\textless} 1 m/s (Type I neurons, 0.49 +/- 0.37 m/s; Type {II} neurons, 0.33 +/- 0.13 m/s).},

	abstract = {Glomeruli, the initial sites of synaptic processing in the olfactory system, contain at least three types of neurons collectively referred to as juxtaglomerular ({JG)} neurons. The role of {JG} neurons in odor processing is poorly understood. We investigated the morphology, spontaneous, and sensory-evoked activity of one class of {JG} neurons, external tufted ({ET)} cells, using whole-cell patch-clamp and extracellular recordings in rat olfactory bulb slices. {ET} cells have extensive dendrites that ramify within a single glomerulus or, rarely, in two adjacent glomeruli. All {ET} neurons exhibit spontaneous rhythmic bursts of action potentials (approximately 1-8 bursts/sec). Bursting is intrinsically generated; bursting persisted and became more regular in the presence of ionotropic glutamate and {GABA} receptor antagonists. Burst frequency is voltage dependent; frequency increased at membrane potentials depolarized relative to rest and decreased during membrane potential hyperpolarization. Spontaneous bursting persisted in blockers of calcium channels that eliminated low-threshold calcium spikes ({LTS)} in {ET} cells. {ET} cells have a persistent sodium current available at membrane potentials that generate spontaneous bursting. Internal perfusion with a fast sodium channel blocker eliminated spontaneous bursting but did not block the {LTS.} These results suggest that persistent sodium channels are essential for spontaneous burst generation in {ET} cells. {ET} cell bursts were entrained to {ON} stimuli delivered over the range of theta frequencies. Thus, {ET} cells appear to be tuned to the frequency of sniffing.},

Our approach builds on the available, frequently rudimentary information, and identifies which experimental set-up provides most additional information about all the parameters, or individual parameters. We will also consider the related but subtly different problem of which experiments need to be performed in order to decrease the uncertainty about the behaviour of the system under altered conditions. We develop the theoretical framework in the necessary detail before illustrating its use and applying it to the repressilator model, the regulation of Hes1 and signal transduction in the Akt pathway.},

However, the finer-scale connectivity of an individual {LN} varied considerably across brains, and there was notable physiological variability within each morphological or genetic class. Finally, {LN} innervation required interaction with olfactory receptor neurons during development, and some individual variability also likely reflected {LN-LN} interactions.

However, only rarely are metadata available in a structured, comprehensive, and machine-readable form. This poses a severe problem for finding and retrieving data, both in the laboratory and on the various emerging public data bases. Here, we propose a simple format, the "open {metaData} Markup Language" ({odML)}, for collecting and exchanging metadata in an automated, computer-based fashion. In {odML} arbitrary metadata information is stored as extended key-value pairs in a hierarchical structure. Central to {odML} is a clear separation of format and content, i.e., neither keys nor values are defined by the format. This makes {odML} flexible enough for storing all available metadata instantly without the necessity to submit new keys to an ontology or controlled terminology. Common standard keys can be defined in {odML-terminologies} for guaranteeing interoperability. We started to define such terminologies for neurophysiological data, but aim at a community driven extension and refinement of the proposed definitions. By customized terminologies that map to these standard terminologies, metadata can be named and organized as required or preferred without softening the standard. Together with the respective libraries provided for common programming languages, the {odML} format can be integrated into the laboratory workflow, facilitating automated collection of metadata information where it becomes available. The flexibility of {odML} also encourages a community driven collection and definition of terms used for annotating data in the neurosciences.},

This is because {PN} ensemble representations changed relatively continuously over a range of concentrations of each odorant. The {PNs'} targets in the mushroom body-Kenyon cells ({KCs)-had} sparse identity-specific responses with diverse degrees of concentration invariance.

I ask whether networks with different sets of underlying parameters can nonetheless respond reliably to neuromodulation and other global perturbations. At the computational level, I describe a paradigm shift in which it is becoming increasingly common to develop families of models that reflect the variance in the biological data that the models are intended to illuminate rather than single, highly tuned models. On the experimental side, I discuss the inherent limitations of overreliance on mean data and suggest that it is important to look for compensations and correlations among as many system parameters as possible, and between each system parameter and circuit performance. This second paradigm shift will require moving away from measurements of each system component in isolation but should reveal important previously undescribed principles in the organization of complex systems such as brains.},

Strong inferences about neural computation are made from the results of such studies, so it is important that these results be accurate. However, the preliminary step in the analysis of such data, the assignment of spike waveforms to individual neurons (“spike-sorting”), makes a critical assumption which undermines the analysis: that spikes, and hence neurons, are independent. We show that this assumption guarantees that coincident spiking estimates such as correlation coefficients are biased. We also show how to eliminate this bias. Our solution involves sorting spikes jointly, which contrasts with the current practice of sorting spikes independently of other spikes. This new “ensemble sorting” yields unbiased estimates of coincident spiking, and permits more data to be analyzed with confidence, improving the quality and quantity of neurophysiological inferences. These results should be of interest outside the context of neuronal correlations studies. Indeed, simultaneous recording of many neurons has become the rule rather than the exception in experiments, so it is essential to spike sort correctly if we are to make valid inferences about any properties of, and relationships between, neurons.},

	abstract = {Stimulus-evoked oscillatory synchronization of neural assemblies has been described in the olfactory and visual systems of several vertebrates and invertebrates. In locusts, information about odour identity is contained in the timing of action potentials in an oscillatory population response, suggesting that oscillations may reflect a common reference for messages encoded in time. Although the stimulus-evoked oscillatory phenomenon is reliable, its roles in sensation, perception, memory formation and pattern recognition remain to be demonstrated--a task requiring a behavioural paradigm. Using honeybees, we now demonstrate that odour encoding involves, as it does in locusts, the oscillatory synchronization of assemblies of projection neurons and that this synchronization is also selectively abolished by picrotoxin, an antagonist of the {GABA(A)} (gamma-aminobutyric acid) receptor. By using a behavioural learning paradigm, we show that picrotoxin-induced desynchronization impairs the discrimination of molecularly similar odorants, but not that of dissimilar odorants. It appears, therefore, that oscillatory synchronization of neuronal assemblies is functionally relevant, and essential for fine sensory discrimination. This suggests that oscillatory synchronization and the kind of temporal encoding it affords provide an additional dimension by which the brain could segment spatially overlapping stimulus representations.},

Despite the fact that strong trial-to-trial correlated variability in responses has been reported in many cortical areas, recent evidence suggests that neuronal correlations are much lower than previously thought. Here, we used multicontact laminar probes to revisit the issue of correlated variability in primary visual (V1) cortical circuits. We found that correlations between neurons depend strongly on local network context—whereas neurons in the input (granular) layers showed virtually no correlated variability, neurons in the output layers (supragranular and infragranular) exhibited strong correlations. The laminar dependence of noise correlations is consistent with recurrent models in which neurons in the granular layer receive intracortical inputs from nearby cells, whereas supragranular and infragranular layer neurons receive inputs over larger distances. Contrary to expectation that the output cortical layers encode stimulus information most accurately, we found that the input network offers superior discrimination performance compared to the output networks.},

Scientists discover qualitatively new forms of structure in observed data: For instance, Linnaeus recognized the hierarchical organization of biological species, and Mendeleev recognized the periodic structure of the chemical elements. Analogous insights play a pivotal role in cognitive development: Children discover that object category labels can be organized into hierarchies, friendship networks are organized into cliques, and comparative relations (e.g., “bigger than” or “better than”) respect a transitive order. Standard algorithms, however, can only learn structures of a single form that must be specified in advance: For instance, algorithms for hierarchical clustering create tree structures, whereas algorithms for dimensionality-reduction create low-dimensional spaces. Here, we present a computational model that learns structures of many different forms and that discovers which form is best for a given dataset. The model makes probabilistic inferences over a space of graph grammars representing trees, linear orders, multidimensional spaces, rings, dominance hierarchies, cliques, and other forms and successfully discovers the underlying structure of a variety of physical, biological, and social domains. Our approach brings structure learning methods closer to human abilities and may lead to a deeper computational understanding of cognitive development.},

	volume = {82},
	issn = {0022-3077},
	abstract = {Current-clamp recordings were made from the deep cerebellar nuclei ({DCN)} of 12- to 15-day-old rats to understand the factors that mediate intrinsic spontaneous firing patterns. All of the cells recorded were spontaneously active with spiking patterns ranging continuously from regular spiking to spontaneous bursting with the former predominating. A robust rebound depolarization ({RD)} leading to a Na(+) spike burst was elicited after the offset of hyperpolarizing current injection. The voltage and time dependence of the {RD} was consistent with mediation by low-threshold voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels. In addition, induction of a {RD} also may be affected by activation of a hyperpolarization-activated cation current, I(h). A {RD} could be evoked efficiently after brief high-frequency bursts of inhibitory postsynaptic potentials ({IPSPs)} induced by stimulation of Purkinje cell axons. {IPSP-driven} {RDs} were typically much larger and longer than those elicited by direct hyperpolarizing pulses of approximately matched amplitude and duration. Intracellular perfusion of the Ca(2+) buffer bis-(o-aminophenoxy)-{N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic} acid ({BAPTA)} dramatically enhanced the {RD} and its associated spiking, sometimes leading to a plateau potential that lasted several hundred milliseconds. The effects of {BAPTA} could be mimicked partly by application of apamin, a blocker of small conductance Ca(2+)-gated K(+) channels, but not by paxilline, which blocks large conductance Ca(2+)-gated K(+) channels. Application of both {BAPTA} and apamin, but not paxilline, caused cells that were regularly spiking to burst spontaneously. Taken together, our data suggest that there is a strong relationship between the ability of {DCN} cells to elicit a {RD} and their tendency burst spontaneously. The {RD} can be triggered by the opening of T-type Ca(2+) channels with an additional contribution of hyperpolarization-activated current I(h). {RD} duration is regulated by small-conductance Ca(2+)-gated K(+) channels. The {RD} also is modulated tonically by inhibitory inputs. All of these factors are in turn subject to alteration by extrinsic modulatory neurotransmitters and are, at least in part, responsible for determining the firing modes of {DCN} neurons.},

Various authors have proposed alternative classification schemes that rely on the concomitant observation of several multimodal features. However, a broad variability is generally observed even among cells that are grouped into a same class. Furthermore, the attribution of specific neurons to a single defined class is often difficult, because individual properties vary in a highly graded fashion, suggestive of continua of features between types. Going beyond the description of representative traits of distinct classes, we focus here on the analysis of atypical cells. We introduce a novel paradigm for neuronal type classification, assuming explicitly the existence of a structured continuum of diversity. Our approach, grounded on the theory of fuzzy sets, identifies a small optimal number of model archetypes. At the same time, it quantifies the degree of similarity between these archetypes and each considered neuron. This allows highlighting archetypal cells, which bear a clear similarity to a single model archetype, and edge cells, which manifest a convergence of traits from multiple archetypes.},

	abstract = {Most voluntary actions rely on neural circuits that map sensory cues onto appropriate motor responses. One might expect that for everyday movements, like reaching, this mapping would remain stable over time, at least in the absence of error feedback. Here we describe a simple and novel psychophysical phenomenon in which recent experience shapes the statistical properties of reaching, independent of any movement errors. Specifically, when recent movements are made to targets near a particular location subsequent movements to that location become less variable, but at the cost of increased bias for reaches to other targets. This process exhibits the variance-bias tradeoff that is a hallmark of Bayesian estimation. We provide evidence that this process reflects a fast, trial-by-trial learning of the prior distribution of targets. We also show that these results may reflect an emergent property of associative learning in neural circuits. We demonstrate that adding Hebbian (associative) learning to a model network for reach planning leads to a continuous modification of network connections that biases network dynamics toward activity patterns associated with recent inputs. This learning process quantitatively captures the key results of our experimental data in human subjects, including the effect that recent experience has on the variance-bias tradeoff. This network also provides a good approximation of a normative Bayesian estimator. These observations illustrate how associative learning can incorporate recent experience into ongoing computations in a statistically principled way.},

We further determined that cells similar in their expression patterns were also similar in their electrical properties. Subsequent regression modeling with statistical resampling yielded a set of coefficients that reliably predicted electrical properties from the expression profile of individual neurons.

Stereotyped circuitry within the cerebellar cortex suggests that similar computations are performed throughout the cerebellum, but little is known about whether diverse precerebellar neurons are specialized for the nature of the information they convey. In vivo recordings indicate that firing responses to sensory or motor stimuli vary dramatically across different precerebellar nuclei, but whether this reflects diverse synaptic inputs or differentially tuned intrinsic excitability has not been determined. We targeted whole-cell patch-clamp recordings to neurons in eight precerebellar nuclei which were retrogradely labeled from different regions of the cerebellum in mice. Intrinsic physiology was compared across neurons in the medial vestibular, external cuneate, lateral reticular, prepositus hypoglossi, supragenual, Roller/intercalatus, reticularis tegmenti pontis, and pontine nuclei. Within the firing domain, precerebellar neurons were remarkably similar. Firing faithfully followed temporally modulated inputs, could be sustained at high rates, and was a linear function of input current over a wide range of inputs and firing rates. Pharmacological analyses revealed common expression of Kv3 currents, which were essential for a wide linear firing range, and of {SK} (small-conductance calcium-activated potassium) currents, which were essential for a wide linear input range. In contrast, membrane properties below spike threshold varied considerably within and across precerebellar nuclei, as evidenced by variability in postinhibitory rebound firing. Our findings indicate that diverse precerebellar neurons perform similar scaling computations on their inputs but may be differentially tuned to synaptic inhibition.},

	abstract = {Neuronal response properties are typically probed by intracellular measurements of current-voltage (I-V) relationships during application of current or voltage steps. Here we demonstrate the measurement of a novel I-V curve measured while the neuron exhibits a fluctuating voltage and emits spikes. This dynamic I-V curve requires only a few tens of seconds of experimental time and so lends itself readily to the rapid classification of cell type, quantification of heterogeneities in cell populations, and generation of reduced analytical models. We apply this technique to layer-5 pyramidal cells and show that their dynamic I-V curve comprises linear and exponential components, providing experimental evidence for a recently proposed theoretical model. The approach also allows us to determine the change of neuronal response properties after a spike, millisecond by millisecond, so that postspike refractoriness of pyramidal cells can be quantified. Observations of I-V curves during and in absence of refractoriness are cast into a model that is used to predict both the subthreshold response and spiking activity of the neuron to novel stimuli. The predictions of the resulting model are in excellent agreement with experimental data and close to the intrinsic neuronal reproducibility to repeated stimuli.},

	abstract = {Spatiotemporal patterning of neuronal activity is considered to be an important feature of cognitive processing in the brain as well as pathological brain states, such as seizures. Here, we investigate complex interactions between intrinsic properties of neurons and network structure in the generation of network spatiotemporal patterning in the context of seizure-like synchrony. We show that membrane excitability properties have differential effects on network activity patterning for different network topologies. We consider excitatory networks consisting of neurons with excitability properties varying between type I and type {II} that exhibit significantly different spike frequency responses to external current stimulation, especially at firing threshold. We find that networks with type {II-like} neurons show higher synchronization and bursting capacity across a range of network topologies than corresponding networks with type I-like neurons. These differences in activity patterning are persistent across different network sizes, connectivity strengths, magnitudes of random external input, and the addition of inhibitory interneurons to the network, making them highly likely to be relevant to brain function. Furthermore, we show that heterogeneous networks of mixed cell types show emergent dynamical patterns even for very low mixing ratios. Specifically, the addition of a small percentage of type {II-like} cells into a network of type I-like cells can markedly change the patterning of network activity. These findings suggest that cellular as well as network mechanisms can go hand in hand, leading to the generation of seizure-like discharges, suggesting that a single ictogenic mechanism alone may not be responsible for seizure generation.},

It is thus vitally important to reconstruct protein-protein interactions ({PPIs)} before we can fully understand biological processes. However, critical difficulties exist. Particularly the rate of wrongly predicting {PPIs} to be true (false positive rate) is extremely high in {PPIs} prediction. The traditional approaches of error correction from each generating source can be both time-consuming and inefficient. We propose a method that can substantially reduce false positive rates by emphasizing information from more reliable data sources, and de-emphasizing less reliable sources. We indicate that it is indeed the case from our extensive studies. Our predictions also suggest that large numbers of not only false positives but also false negatives may exist in previous studies, as validated by two human {PPIs} datasets having high quality. The ability to predict large numbers of {PPIs} both reliably and automatically may inspire people to use computational approaches to correct data errors in general, and speed up {PPIs} prediction with high quality. Reliable prediction from our method may benefit other studies involving such as protein function prediction and roles of {PPIs} in disease susceptibility.},

Ion channel gene expression differed both qualitatively and quantitatively across cell types and could distinguish subtle differences in intrinsic electrophysiology. Single-cell transcript profiling of {MVN} neurons established six functionally distinct cell types and associated marker genes.

	abstract = {Generalized linear models ({GLMs)} have been developed for modeling and decoding population neuronal spiking activity in the motor cortex. These models provide reasonable characterizations between neural activity and motor behavior. However, they lack a description of movement-related terms which are not observed directly in these experiments, such as muscular activation, the subject's level of attention, and other internal or external states. Here we propose to include a multi-dimensional hidden state to address these states in a {GLM} framework where the spike count at each time is described as a function of the hand state (position, velocity, and acceleration), truncated spike history, and the hidden state. The model can be identified by an Expectation-Maximization algorithm. We tested this new method in two datasets where spikes were simultaneously recorded using a multi-electrode array in the primary motor cortex of two monkeys. It was found that this method significantly improves the model-fitting over the classical {GLM}, for hidden dimensions varying from 1 to 4. This method also provides more accurate decoding of hand state (reducing the mean square error by up to 29\% in some cases), while retaining real-time computational efficiency. These improvements on representation and decoding over the classical {GLM} model suggest that this new approach could contribute as a useful tool to motor cortical decoding and prosthetic applications.},

	abstract = {A subpopulation of neurons in the globus pallidus projects to the neostriatum, which is the major recipient of afferent information to the basal ganglia. Given the moderate nature of this projection, we hypothesized that the pallidostriatal projection might exert indirect but powerful control over principal neuron activity by targeting interneurons, which comprise only a small percentage of neostriatal neurons. This was tested by the juxtacellular labeling and recording of pallidal neurons in combination with immunolabeling of postsynaptic neurons. In addition to innervating the subthalamic nucleus and output nuclei, 6 of 23 labeled pallidal neurons projected to the neostriatum. Both the firing characteristics and the extent of the axonal arborization in the neostriatum were variable. However, light and electron microscopic analysis of five pallidostriatal neurons revealed that each neuron selectively innervated neostriatal interneurons. A large proportion of the boutons of an individual axon (19-66\%) made contact with parvalbumin-immunoreactive interneurons. An individual parvalbumin-immunoreactive neuron (n = 27) was apposed on average by 6.7 boutons ({SD} = 6.1) from a single pallidal axon (n = 2). Individual pallidostriatal boutons typically possessed more than one symmetrical synaptic specialization. In addition, 3-32\% of boutons of axons from four of five pallidal neurons contacted nitric oxide synthase-immunoreactive neurons. Descending collaterals of pallidostriatal neurons were also found to make synaptic contact with dopaminergic and {GABAergic} neurons of the substantia nigra. These data imply that during periods of cortical activation, individual pallidal neurons may influence the activity of {GABAergic} interneurons of the neostriatum (which are involved in feed-forward inhibition and synchronization of principle neuron activity) while simultaneously patterning neuronal activity in basal ganglia downstream of the neostriatum.},

We combined the algorithm with a delayed-match-to-sample task, to test how the optimal contours might be molded by the monkey's expectation for particular cue shapes. We found that V1 neurons were selective for complex shapes, a property previously ascribed to higher cortical areas. Furthermore, the shape selectivity was reprogrammed by perceptual task: Over the whole network, the optimal modes of geometric selectivity shifted between distinct subsets of the {AF}, alternately representing different stimulus features known to predominate in natural scenes. Our results suggest a general model of cortical function, whereby horizontal connections provide a broad domain of potential associations, and top–down inputs dynamically gate these linkages to task switch the function of a network.},

We asked, how should such interactions be organized to maximize the amount of information represented in population responses? To this end, we extended the linear-nonlinear-Poisson model of single neural response to include pairwise interactions, yielding a stimulus-dependent, pairwise maximum-entropy model. We found that as we varied the noise level in single neurons and the distribution of network inputs, the optimal pairwise interactions smoothly interpolated to achieve network functions that are usually regarded as discrete—stimulus decorrelation, error correction, and independent encoding. These functions reflected a trade-off between efficient consumption of finite neural bandwidth and the use of redundancy to mitigate noise. Spontaneous activity in the optimal network reflected stimulus-induced activity patterns, and single-neuron response variability overestimated network noise. Our analysis suggests that rather than having a single coding principle hardwired in their architecture, networks in the brain should adapt their function to changing noise and stimulus correlations.},

	abstract = {To fire at high rates, neurons express ionic currents that work together to minimize refractory periods by ensuring that sodium channels are available for activation shortly after each action potential. Vestibular nucleus neurons operate around high baseline firing rates and encode information with bidirectional modulation of firing rates up to several hundred Hz. To determine the mechanisms that enable these neurons to sustain firing at high rates, ionic currents were measured during firing by using the action potential clamp technique in vestibular nucleus neurons acutely dissociated from transgenic mice. Although neurons from the {YFP-16} line fire at rates higher than those from the {GIN} line, both classes of neurons express Kv3 and {BK} currents as well as both transient and resurgent Na currents. In the fastest firing neurons, Kv3 currents dominated repolarization at all firing rates and minimized Na channel inactivation by rapidly transitioning Na channels from the open to the closed state. In slower firing neurons, {BK} currents dominated repolarization at the highest firing rates and sodium channel availability was protected by a resurgent blocking mechanism. Quantitative differences in Kv3 current density across neurons and qualitative differences in immunohistochemically detected expression of Kv3 subunits could account for the difference in firing range within and across cell classes. These results demonstrate how divergent firing properties of two neuronal populations arise through the interplay of at least three ionic currents.},

	abstract = {Neurons in cortical area V4 respond selectively to complex visual patterns such as curved contours and non-Cartesian gratings. Most previous experiments in V4 have measured responses to small, idiosyncratic stimulus sets and no single functional model yet accounts for all of the disparate results. We propose that one model, the spectral receptive field ({SRF)}, can explain many observations of selectivity in V4. The {SRF} describes tuning in terms of the orientation and spatial frequency spectrum and can, in principle, predict the response to any visual stimulus. We estimated {SRFs} for neurons in V4 of awake primates by linearized reverse correlation of responses to a large set of natural images. We find that V4 neurons have large orientation and spatial frequency bandwidth and often bimodal orientation tuning. For comparison, we estimated {SRFs} for neurons in primary visual cortex (V1). Consistent with previous observations, we find that V1 neurons have narrower bandwidth than that of V4. To determine whether estimated {SRFs} can account for previous observations of selectivity, we used them to predict responses to Cartesian gratings, non-Cartesian gratings, natural images, and curved contours. Based on these predictions, we find that the majority of neurons in V1 are selective for Cartesian gratings, whereas the majority of V4 neurons are selective for non-Cartesian gratings or natural images. The {SRF} describes visual tuning properties with a second-order nonlinear model. These results support the hypothesis that a second-order model is sufficient to describe the general mechanisms mediating shape selectivity in area V4.},

We studied the effect of clustered excitatory connections on the dynamics of neuronal networks that exhibited high spike time variability owing to a balance between excitation and inhibition. Even modest clustering substantially changed the behavior of these networks, introducing slow dynamics during which clusters of neurons transiently increased or decreased their firing rate. Consequently, neurons exhibited both fast spiking variability and slow firing rate fluctuations. A simplified model shows how stimuli bias networks toward particular activity states, thereby reducing firing rate variability as observed experimentally in many cortical areas. Our model thus relates cortical architecture to the reported variability in spontaneous and evoked spiking activity.},

	abstract = {A computational model of the rat subthalamic nucleus projection neuron is constructed using electrophysiological and morphological data and a restricted set of channel specifications. The model cell exhibits a wide range of electrophysiological behaviors characteristic of rat subthalamic neurons. It reveals that a key set of three channels play a primary role in distinguishing behaviors: a high-voltage-activated calcium channel (Cav 1.2.-1.3), a low-voltage-activated calcium channel (Cav 3.-), and a small current calcium-activated potassium channel ({KCa} 2.1-2.3). Short and long posthyperpolarization rebound responses, low-frequency rhythmic bursting ({\textless} 1 Hz), higher-frequency rhythmic bursting (4-7 Hz), and slow action and depolarizing potentials are behaviors all mediated by the interaction of these channels. This interaction can generate a robust calcium-dependent extended depolarization in the dendrites (a depolarizing plateau). The diversity observed in the rat subthalamic physiology (such as short or long rebounds, or the presence of low-frequency rhythmic busting) can arise from alterations in both the density and distributions of these channel types and, consequently, their ability to generate this depolarizing plateau. A number of important predictions arise from the model. For example, blocking or disrupting the low-voltage-activated Cav 3.- calcium current should mute the emergence of rebound responses and rhythmic bursting. Conversely, increasing this channel current via large hyperpolarizing potentials in combination with partial blockade of the high-voltage-activated calcium channels should lead to the more experimentally elusive in vitro high-frequency bursting.},

	abstract = {In a 1935 paper and in his book Theory of probability, Jeffresy developed a methodology for quantifying the evidence in favor of a scientific theory. The centerpies was a number, now called the Bayes factor, which is the posterior odds of the null hypothesis when the prior probability on the null is one-half. Although there has been much discussion of Bayesian hypothesis testing in the context of criticism of P-values, less attention has been given to the Bayes as a practical tool of applied statistics. In this article we review and discuss the uses of Bayes factors in the context of five scientific applications in genetics, sports, ecology, sociology, and psychology. We emphasize the following points: From Jeffrey's Bayesian viewpoint, the purpose of hypothesis testing is to evaluate the evidence in favor of a scientific theory. Bayes factors offer a way of evaluating evidence in favor of a null hypothesis. Bayes factors provide a way of incorporating external information into the evaluation of evidence about a hypothesis. Bayes factors are very general and do not require alternative models to be nested. Several techniques are available for computing Bayes factors, including asymptotic approximations that are easy to compute using the output from standard packages that maximize likelihoods. In "non-Bayesian significance tests. The Schwarz criterion (or {BIC)} gives a rough approximation to the logarithm of the Bayes factor, which is easy to use and does not require evaluation of prior distributions. When one is interested in estimation or prediction, Bayes factors may be converted to weights to be attached to various models so that a composite estimate or prediction may be obtained that takes account of structural or model uncertainty. Algorithms have been proposed that allow model uncertainty to be taken into account when the class of models initially considered is very large. Bayes factors are useful for guiding an evolutionary model-building process. It is important, and feasible, to assess the sensitivity of conclusions to the prior distributions used.},

	abstract = {A spiking neuron "computes" by transforming a complex dynamical input into a train of action potentials, or spikes. The computation performed by the neuron can be formulated as dimensional reduction, or feature detection, followed by a nonlinear decision function over the low-dimensional space. Generalizations of the reverse correlation technique with white noise input provide a numerical strategy for extracting the relevant low-dimensional features from experimental data, and information theory can be used to evaluate the quality of the low-dimensional approximation. We apply these methods to analyze the simplest biophysically realistic model neuron, the Hodgkin-Huxley ({HH)} model, using this system to illustrate the general methodological issues. We focus on the features in the stimulus that trigger a spike, explicitly eliminating the effects of interactions between spikes. One can approximate this triggering "feature space" as a two-dimensional linear subspace in the high-dimensional space of input histories, capturing in this way a substantial fraction of the mutual information between inputs and spike time. We find that an even better approximation, however, is to describe the relevant subspace as two dimensional but curved; in this way, we can capture 90\% of the mutual information even at high time resolution. Our analysis provides a new understanding of the computational properties of the {HH} model. While it is common to approximate neural behavior as "integrate and fire," the {HH} model is not an integrator nor is it well described by a single threshold.},

We recorded from populations of cells in the cat visual cortex (area 17) to examine whether the joint activity of cells can support finer discrimination than found in individual responses. Analysis of joint firing yields a substantial advantage (i.e., cooperation) in fine-angle discrimination. This cooperation increases to more considerable levels as the population of an assembly is increased. The cooperation in a population of six cells provides encoding of orientation with an information advantage that is at least 2-fold in terms of requiring either fewer cells or less time than independent coding. This cooperation suggests that correlated or synchronized activity can increase information.},

	abstract = {Neuronal circuitry is often considered a clean slate that can be dynamically and arbitrarily molded by experience. However, when we investigated synaptic connectivity in groups of pyramidal neurons in the neocortex, we found that both connectivity and synaptic weights were surprisingly predictable. Synaptic weights follow very closely the number of connections in a group of neurons, saturating after only 20\% of possible connections are formed between neurons in a group. When we examined the network topology of connectivity between neurons, we found that the neurons cluster into small world networks that are not scale-free, with less than 2 degrees of separation. We found a simple clustering rule where connectivity is directly proportional to the number of common neighbors, which accounts for these small world networks and accurately predicts the connection probability between any two neurons. This pyramidal neuron network clusters into multiple groups of a few dozen neurons each. The neurons composing each group are surprisingly distributed, typically more than 100 μm apart, allowing for multiple groups to be interlaced in the same space. In summary, we discovered a synaptic organizing principle that groups neurons in a manner that is common across animals and hence, independent of individual experiences. We speculate that these elementary neuronal groups are prescribed Lego-like building blocks of perception and that acquired memory relies more on combining these elementary assemblies into higher-order constructs.},

	abstract = {In this letter, we develop and simulate a large-scale network of spiking neurons that approximates the inference computations performed by graphical models. Unlike previous related schemes, which used sum and product operations in either the log or linear domains, the current model uses an inference scheme based on the sum and maximization operations in the log domain. Simulations show that using these operations, a large-scale circuit, which combines populations of spiking neurons as basic building blocks, is capable of finding close approximations to the full mathematical computations performed by graphical models within a few hundred milliseconds. The circuit is general in the sense that it can be wired for any graph structure, it supports multistate variables, and it uses standard leaky integrate-and-fire neuronal units. Following previous work, which proposed relations between graphical models and the large-scale cortical anatomy, we focus on the cortical microcircuitry and propose how anatomical and physiological aspects of the local circuitry may map onto elements of the graphical model implementation. We discuss in particular the roles of three major types of inhibitory neurons (small fast-spiking basket cells, large layer 2/3 basket cells, and double-bouquet neurons), subpopulations of strongly interconnected neurons with their unique connectivity patterns in different cortical layers, and the possible role of minicolumns in the realization of the population-based maximum operation.},

Regardless of whether one approaches the problem from an encoding or decoding perspective, the main measures used to study the role of correlations can be derived from a common source: the expansion of the mutual information. Two main formalisms of mutual information expansion have been proposed: the series expansion and the exact breakdown. Here we clarify that these two formalisms have a different representation of autocorrelations, so that even when the total information estimated differs by less than 1\%, individual terms can diverge. More precisely, the series expansion explicitly evaluates the informational contribution of autocorrelations in the count of spikes, that is, count autocorrelations, whereas the exact breakdown does not. We propose a new formalism of mutual information expansion, the Poisson exact breakdown, which introduces Poisson equivalents in order to explicitly evaluate the informational contribution of count autocorrelations with no approximation involved. Because several widely employed manipulations of spike trains, most notably binning and pooling, alter the structure of count autocorrelations, the new formalism can provide a useful general framework for studying the role of correlations in population codes.},

covariates, previous spiking, and an input-dependent charging/discharging capacitor model, our approach robustly captures
the aforementioned features on datasets taken at the auditory nerve of chinchilla in response to speech inputs. We confirm

Simultaneously increasing both excitatory and inhibitory background firing rates in a balanced manner results in a divisive gain modulation of the neuronal response without appreciable signal-independent increases in firing rate or spike-train variability. These results suggest that, within active cortical circuits, the overall level of synaptic input to a neuron acts as a gain control signal that modulates responsiveness to excitatory drive.},

This similarity poses an intriguing puzzle: why is psychophysical sensitivity not greater than that of single neurons? Pooling responses across neurons should average out noise in the activity of single cells, leading to substantially improved psychophysical performance. If, however, noise is correlated among these neurons, the beneficial effects of pooling would be diminished. To assess correlation within a pool, the responses of pairs of neurons were recorded simultaneously during repeated stimulus presentations. We report here that the observed covariation in spike count was relatively weak, the correlation coefficient averaging 0.12.

	abstract = {Most theories of motor cortex have assumed that neural activity represents movement parameters. This view derives from what is known about primary visual cortex, where neural activity represents patterns of light. Yet it is unclear how well the analogy between motor and visual cortex holds. Single-neuron responses in motor cortex are complex, and there is marked disagreement regarding which movement parameters are represented. A better analogy might be with other motor systems, where a common principle is rhythmic neural activity. Here we find that motor cortex responses during reaching contain a brief but strong oscillatory component, something quite unexpected for a non-periodic behaviour. Oscillation amplitude and phase followed naturally from the preparatory state, suggesting a mechanistic role for preparatory neural activity. These results demonstrate an unexpected yet surprisingly simple structure in the population response. This underlying structure explains many of the confusing features of individual neural responses.},

	abstract = {Over 1,500 human disease genes have been identified, of which only a small fraction have experimental structural information on the protein products. To better understand the mechanisms of these hereditary diseases, we undertook a systematic study to predict the structures of disease proteins and characterize their interactions with other proteins. This study was facilitated by two tools developed previously: {COBLATH}, a structure-prediction method that exploits the complementarity of {PSI-Blast} and sequence-structure threading and {PPISP}, a method that predicts the residues involved in protein-protein interactions. In this initial study of human disease proteins, we were able to build structural models for 60 proteins involved in human diseases. For a number of proteins, new structural domains were identified. In the case of {ABCD1}, a protein responsible for adrenoleukodystrophy, the disease mutation {P484R} was positioned at the homodimer interface. This positioning is consistent with experimental observation that the {P484R} mutation impairs {ABCD1} self-interaction and suggests that that the disease mechanism of this mutation lies in the impaired {ABCD1} dimerization. This initial study illustrates the value of the predicted structure models and may serve as an example for expanded studies of other disease proteins.},

The initiation of {LLDs} requires activation of non-{NMDA} but not {NMDA} receptors. Dual recordings from the apical dendrites and somata of mitral cells show that {LLDs} are generated in the distal portion of the apical dendrite, most likely in the glomerulus. The rising phase of {LLDs} shows characteristics of polyneuronal input, including a high variability and sensitivity to charge screening. Paired recordings from adjacent mitral cells suggest that {LLDs} occur synchronously only in cells whose apical dendrites ramify in the same glomerulus. These findings suggest that {LLDs} involve recurrent, intraglomerular dendrodendritic interactions among {M/T} cells.},

	abstract = {Decoding the activity of a population of neurons is a fundamental problem in neuroscience. A key aspect of this problem is determining whether correlations in the activity, i.e., noise correlations, are important. If they are important, then the decoding problem is high dimensional: decoding algorithms must take the correlational structure in the activity into account. If they are not important, or if they play a minor role, then the decoding problem can be reduced to lower dimension and thus made more tractable. The issue of whether correlations are important has been a subject of heated debate. The debate centers around the validity of the measures used to address it. Here, we evaluate three of the most commonly used ones: synergy, {\{Delta\}Ishuffled}, and {\{Delta\}I.} We show that synergy and {\{Delta\}Ishuffled} are confounded measures: they can be zero when correlations are clearly important for decoding and positive when they are not. In contrast, {\{Delta\}I} is not confounded. It is zero only when correlations are not important for decoding and positive only when they are; that is, it is zero only when one can decode exactly as well using a decoder that ignores correlations as one can using a decoder that does not, and it is positive only when one cannot decode as well. Finally, we show that {\{Delta\}I} has an information theoretic interpretation; it is an upper bound on the information lost when correlations are ignored.},

	abstract = {The pattern of connections among cortical excitatory cells with overlapping arbors is non-random. In particular, correlations among connections produce clustering – cells in cliques connect to each other with high probability, but with lower probability to cells in other spatially intertwined cliques. In this study, we model initially randomly connected sparse recurrent networks of spiking neurons with random, overlapping inputs, to investigate what functional and structural synaptic plasticity mechanisms sculpt network connections into the patterns measured in vitro. Our Hebbian implementation of structural plasticity causes a removal of connections between uncorrelated excitatory cells, followed by their random replacement. To model a biconditional discrimination task, we stimulate the network via pairs (A + B, C + D, A + D, and C + B) of four inputs (A, B, C, and D). We find networks that produce neurons most responsive to specific paired inputs – a building block of computation and essential role for cortex – contain the excessive clustering of excitatory synaptic connections observed in cortical slices. The same networks produce the best performance in a behavioral readout of the networks’ ability to complete the task. A plasticity mechanism operating on inhibitory connections, long-term potentiation of inhibition, when combined with structural plasticity, indirectly enhances clustering of excitatory cells via excitatory connections. A rate-dependent (triplet) form of spike-timing-dependent plasticity ({STDP)} between excitatory cells is less effective and basic {STDP} is detrimental. Clustering also arises in networks stimulated with single stimuli and in networks undergoing raised levels of spontaneous activity when structural plasticity is combined with functional plasticity. In conclusion, spatially intertwined clusters or cliques of connected excitatory cells can arise via a Hebbian form of structural plasticity operating in initially randomly connected networks.},

	abstract = {The correlation structure of neural activity is believed to play a major role in the encoding and possibly the decoding of information in neural populations. Recently, several methods were developed for exactly controlling the correlation structure of multi-channel synthetic spike trains (Brette, 2009; Krumin and Shoham, 2009; Macke et al., 2009; Gutnisky and Josic, 2010; Tchumatchenko et al., 2010) and, in a related work, correlation-based analysis of spike trains was used for blind identification of single-neuron models (Krumin et al., 2010), for identifying compact auto-regressive models for multi-channel spike trains, and for facilitating their causal network analysis (Krumin and Shoham, 2010). However, the diversity of correlation structures that can be explained by the feed-forward, non-recurrent, generative models used in these studies is limited. Hence, methods based on such models occasionally fail when analyzing correlation structures that are observed in neural activity. Here, we extend this framework by deriving closed-form expressions for the correlation structure of a more powerful multivariate self- and mutually exciting Hawkes model class that is driven by exogenous non-negative inputs. We demonstrate that the resulting Linear-Non-linear-Hawkes ({LNH)} framework is capable of capturing the dynamics of spike trains with a generally richer and more biologically relevant multi-correlation structure, and can be used to accurately estimate the Hawkes kernels or the correlation structure of external inputs in both simulated and real spike trains (recorded from visually stimulated mouse retinal ganglion cells). We conclude by discussing the method's limitations and the broader significance of strengthening the links between neural spike train analysis and classical system identification.},

Here we determined the gene expression profiles of calbindin ({CB)}, parvalbumin ({PV)}, calretinin ({CR)}, neuropeptide Y ({NPY)}, vasoactive intestinal peptide ({VIP)}, somatostatin ({SOM)} and cholecystokinin ({CCK)} in 268 morphologically identified neurones located in layers 2–6 in the juvenile rat somatosensory neocortex. We used patch-clamp electrodes to label neurones with biocytin and harvest the cytoplasm to perform single-cell {RT-multiplex} {PCR.} Quality threshold clustering, an unsupervised algorithm that clustered neurones according to their entire profile of expressed genes, revealed seven distinct clusters. Surprisingly, each cluster preferentially contained one anatomical class. Artificial neural networks using softmax regression predicted anatomical types at nearly optimal statistical levels. Classification tree-splitting ({CART)}, a simple binary neuropeptide decision tree algorithm, revealed the manner in which expression of the multiple {mRNAs} relates to different anatomical classes. Pruning the {CART} tree revealed the key predictors of anatomical class (in order of importance: {SOM}, {PV}, {VIP}, and {NPY).} We reveal here, for the first time, a strong relationship between specific combinations of {NP} and {CaBP} gene expressions and the anatomical class of neocortical neurones.},

	abstract = {Gap junctions constitute the only form of synaptic communication between neurons in the inferior olive ({IO)}, which gives rise to the climbing fibers innervating the cerebellar cortex. Although its exact functional role remains undetermined, electrical coupling was shown to be necessary for the transient formation of functional compartments of {IO} neurons and to underlie the precise timing of climbing fibers required for cerebellar learning. So far, most functional considerations assume the existence of a network of permanently and homogeneously coupled {IO} neurons. Contrasting this notion, our results indicate that coupling within the {IO} is highly variable. By combining tracer-coupling analysis and paired electrophysiological recordings, we found that individual {IO} neurons could be coupled to a highly variable number of neighboring neurons. Furthermore, a given neuron could be coupled at remarkably different strengths with each of its partners. Freeze-fracture analysis of {IO} glomeruli revealed the close proximity of glutamatergic postsynaptic densities to connexin 36-containing gap junctions, at distances comparable to separations between chemical transmitting domains and gap junctions in goldfish mixed contacts, where electrical coupling was shown to be modulated by the activity of glutamatergic synapses. On the basis of structural and molecular similarities with goldfish mixed synapses, we speculate that, rather than being hardwired, variations in coupling could result from glomerulus-specific long-term modulation of gap junctions. This striking heterogeneity of coupling might act to finely influence the synchronization of {IO} neurons, adding an unexpected degree of complexity to olivary networks.},

Prior studies have shown that spike timing depends upon local field potential ({LFP)} phase proximal to the cell body, but few studies have examined the dependence of spiking on distal {LFP} phases in other brain areas far from the neuron or the influence of {LFP-LFP} phase coupling between distal areas on spiking. We investigated these interactions by recording {LFPs} and single-unit activity using multiple microelectrode arrays in several brain areas and then used a unique probabilistic multivariate phase distribution to model the dependence of spike timing on the full pattern of proximal {LFP} phases, distal {LFP} phases, and {LFP-LFP} phase coupling between electrodes. Here we show that spiking activity in single neurons and neuronal ensembles depends on dynamic patterns of oscillatory phase coupling between multiple brain areas, in addition to the effects of proximal {LFP} phase. Neurons that prefer similar patterns of phase coupling exhibit similar changes in spike rates, whereas neurons with different preferences show divergent responses, providing a basic mechanism to bind different neurons together into coordinated cell assemblies. Surprisingly, phase-coupling-based rate correlations are independent of interneuron distance. Phase-coupling preferences correlate with behavior and neural function and remain stable over multiple days. These findings suggest that neuronal oscillations enable selective and dynamic control of distributed functional cell assemblies.},

Most of our knowledge about mitral cell activity has been obtained from recordings in anesthetized animals. We compared odor-elicited changes in firing rate of mitral cells in awake behaving mice and in anesthetized mice. We show that odor-elicited changes in mitral cell firing rate were larger and more frequently observed in the anesthetized than in the awake condition. Only 27\% of mitral cells that showed a response to odors in the anesthetized state were also odor responsive in the awake state. The amplitude of their response in the awake state was smaller, and some of the responses changed sign compared with their responses in the anesthetized state. The odor representation in the olfactory bulb is therefore sparser in awake behaving mice than in anesthetized preparations. A qualitative explanation of the mechanism responsible for this phenomenon is proposed.},

Large grants would be more effective only if scientific impact increases as an accelerating function of grant size. Here, we examine the scientific impact of individual university-based researchers in three disciplines funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada ({NSERC).} We considered four indices of scientific impact: numbers of articles published, numbers of citations to those articles, the most cited article, and the number of highly cited articles, each measured over a four-year period. We related these to the amount of {NSERC} funding received. Impact is positively, but only weakly, related to funding. Researchers who received additional funds from a second federal granting council, the Canadian Institutes for Health Research, were not more productive than those who received only {NSERC} funding. Impact was generally a decelerating function of funding. Impact per dollar was therefore lower for large grant-holders. This is inconsistent with the hypothesis that larger grants lead to larger discoveries. Further, the impact of researchers who received increases in funding did not predictably increase. We conclude that scientific impact (as reflected by publications) is only weakly limited by funding. We suggest that funding strategies that target diversity, rather than “excellence”, are likely to prove to be more productive.},

	abstract = {1. Principles of information theory were used to calculate the limit of accuracy achievable by a subset of the wind-sensitive primary interneurons in the cricket cercal sensory system. For these calculations, an ensemble of four neurons was treated as an information channel, which encoded the direction of air-current stimuli for a defined range of air-current velocities. The specific information theoretic parameter that was calculated was the "transin-formation" or "mutual information" between the air-current directions and the neuronal spike trains, which were characterized in the preceding report. Under the assumptions used for these calculations, the ensemble of four interneurons was demonstrated to be capable of encoding between 4.2 and 3.5 bits of information about wind direction. This corresponds to an average directional accuracy of 4.7 and 7.7 degrees, respectively. 2. The same principles were applied to estimate the extent to which any variation in the width of the tuning curves would affect the transfer of information. As the widths of simulated tuning curves were varied, the mean ensemble accuracy showed a clear global maximum. This maximum corresponds to tuning curves widths of 110 degrees wide (at half maximum), which was remarkably close to the actual mean widths of the tuning curves observed in the cricket of 130 degrees. 3. The effect of varying the parametric "spacing" of the tuning curves within the stimulus range was also examined through a series of simulations. The configuration allowing the maximum information transfer corresponded to equal spacing of the tuning curves around the stimulus range (i.e., 90 degrees separation of peak sensitivity points). This theoretically optimum spacing corresponded exactly to the values observed in the experiments presented in the preceding report. 4. These simulations also showed that the degradation in the accuracy resulting from a shift in the tuning-curve spacing would depend on the plasticity of the higher order decoder of directional information. If there were no plasticity in the interneurons making up the higher order decoder, then the accuracy would be degraded by 50\% for a mean tuning-curve shift of only 3.5 degrees. However, if the higher order decoding network were capable of being reoptimized to any arbitrary shift in tuning curves, the degradation in attainable accuracy would be much less severe as shifts of up to 10 degrees would result in virtually no degradation in the accuracy. 5. From these results, two general conclusions can be drawn about the coding of specific stimulus parameters by arrays of sensory cells.({ABSTRACT} {TRUNCATED} {AT} 400 {WORDS)}},

I then discuss a number of issues raised by this observation, such as which parameter variations arise from compensatory mechanisms and which reflect insensitivity to those particular parameters. I ask whether networks with different sets of underlying parameters can nonetheless respond reliably to neuromodulation and other global perturbations. At the computational level, I describe a paradigm shift in which it is becoming increasingly common to develop families of models that reflect the variance in the biological data that the models are intended to illuminate rather than single, highly tuned models. On the experimental side, I discuss the inherent limitations of overreliance on mean data and suggest that it is important to look for compensations and correlations among as many system parameters as possible, and between each system parameter and circuit performance. This second paradigm shift will require moving away from measurements of each system component in isolation but should reveal important previously undescribed principles in the organization of complex systems such as brains.},

Because of advances in imaging and optogenetic methods, head-fixed mouse preparations provide an unparalleled opportunity to observe and control neural circuits. To investigate how neural circuits produce behavior, these methods need to be paired with equally well-controlled and monitored behavioral paradigms. Here, we introduce the choice ball, a response device that enables two-alternative forced-choice ({2AFC)} tasks in head-fixed mice based on the readout of lateral paw movements. We demonstrate the advantages of the choice ball by training mice in the random-click task, a two-choice auditory discrimination behavior. For each trial, mice listened to binaural streams of Poisson-distributed clicks and were required to roll the choice ball laterally toward the side with the greater click rate. In this assay, mice performed hundreds of trials per session with accuracy ranging from 95\% for easy stimuli (large interaural click-rate contrast) to near chance level for low-contrast stimuli. We also show, using the record of individual paw strokes, that mice often reverse decisions they have already initiated and that decision reversals correlate with improved performance. The choice ball enables head-fixed {2AFC} paradigms, facilitating the circuit-level analysis of sensory processing, decision making, and motor control in mice.},

Although recent work has identified visually-evoked local dendritic calcium signals in the rodent visual cortex, sensory-evoked signalling on the level of dendritic spines, corresponding to individual afferent excitatory synapses, remains unexplored. Here we used a new variant of high-resolution two-photon imaging to detect sensory-evoked calcium transients in single dendritic spines of mouse cortical neurons in vivo. Calcium signals evoked by sound stimulation required the activation of {NMDA} (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors. Active spines are widely distributed on basal and apical dendrites and pure-tone stimulation at different frequencies revealed both narrowly and widely tuned spines. Notably, spines tuned for different frequencies were highly interspersed on the same dendrites: even neighbouring spines were mostly tuned to different frequencies. Thus, our results demonstrate that {NMDA-receptor-dependent} single-spine synaptic inputs to the same dendrite are highly heterogeneous. Furthermore, our study opens the way for in vivo mapping of functionally defined afferent sensory inputs with single-synapse resolution.},

Here we describe the generation and analysis of a transcriptional atlas of the adult human brain, comprising extensive histological analysis and comprehensive microarray profiling of {\textasciitilde}900 neuroanatomically precise subdivisions in two individuals. Transcriptional regulation varies enormously by anatomical location, with different regions and their constituent cell types displaying robust molecular signatures that are highly conserved between individuals. Analysis of differential gene expression and gene co-expression relationships demonstrates that brain-wide variation strongly reflects the distributions of major cell classes such as neurons, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes and microglia. Local neighbourhood relationships between fine anatomical subdivisions are associated with discrete neuronal subtypes and genes involved with synaptic transmission. The neocortex displays a relatively homogeneous transcriptional pattern, but with distinct features associated selectively with primary sensorimotor cortices and with enriched frontal lobe expression. Notably, the spatial topography of the neocortex is strongly reflected in its molecular topography—the closer two cortical regions, the more similar their transcriptomes.

	abstract = {As large-scale, detailed network modeling projects are flourishing in the field of computational neuroscience, it is more and more important to design single neuron models that not only capture qualitative features of real neurons but are quantitatively accurate in silico representations of those. Recent years have seen substantial effort being put in the development of algorithms for the systematic evaluation and optimization of neuron models with respect to electrophysiological data. It is however difficult to compare these methods because of the lack of appropriate benchmark tests. Here, we describe one such effort of providing the community with a standardized set of tests to quantify the performances of single neuron models. Our effort takes the form of a yearly challenge similar to the ones which have been present in the machine learning community for some time. This paper gives an account of the first two challenges which took place in 2007 and 2008 and discusses future directions. The results of the competition suggest that best performance on data obtained from single or double electrode current or conductance injection is achieved by models that combine features of standard leaky integrate-and-fire models with a second variable reflecting adaptation, refractoriness, or a dynamic threshold.},

In such networks, autorhythmic neurons may act as true oscillators (as pacemakers) or as resonators (responding preferentially to certain firing frequencies). Oscillations and resonance in the {CNS} are proposed to have diverse functional roles, such as (i) determining global functional states (for example, sleep-wakefulness or attention), (ii) timing in motor coordination, and (iii) specifying connectivity during development. Also, oscillation, especially in the thalamo-cortical circuits, may be related to certain neurological and psychiatric disorders.

Modeling studies suggest that this can greatly enhance penetration of air and air-born odorants through the antennal sensilla thereby periodically increasing odorant-receptor interactions. Do these periodic changes result in entrainment of neural responses in the antenna and antennal lobe ({AL)?} Does this entrainment affect olfactory acuity? To address these questions, we monitored antennal and {AL} responses in the moth Manduca sexta while odorants were pulsed at frequencies from 10-72 Hz, encompassing the natural wingbeat frequency. Power spectral density ({PSD)} analysis was used to identify entrainment of neural activity. Statistical analysis of {PSDs} indicates that the antennal nerve tracked pulsed odor up to 30 Hz. Furthermore, at least 50\% of {AL} local field potentials ({LFPs)} and between 7-25\% of unitary spiking responses also tracked pulsed odor up to 30 Hz in a frequency-locked manner. Application of bicuculline (200 {muM)} abolished pulse tracking in both {LFP} and unitary responses suggesting that {GABA(A)} receptor activation is necessary for pulse tracking within the {AL.} Finally, psychophysical measures of odor detection establish that detection thresholds are lowered when odor is pulsed at 20 Hz. These results suggest that {AL} networks can respond to the oscillatory dynamics of stimuli such as those imposed by the wing beat in a manner analogous to mammalian sniffing.},

	abstract = {Summary
Quantitative modeling of human brain activity can provide crucial insights about cortical representations [1, 2] and can form the basis for brain decoding devices [3–5]. Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI)} studies have modeled brain activity elicited by static visual patterns and have reconstructed these patterns from brain activity [6–8]. However, blood oxygen level-dependent ({BOLD)} signals measured via {fMRI} are very slow [9], so it has been difficult to model brain activity elicited by dynamic stimuli such as natural movies. Here we present a new motion-energy [10, 11] encoding model that largely overcomes this limitation. The model describes fast visual information and slow hemodynamics by separate components. We recorded {BOLD} signals in occipitotemporal visual cortex of human subjects who watched natural movies and fit the model separately to individual voxels. Visualization of the fit models reveals how early visual areas represent the information in movies. To demonstrate the power of our approach, we also constructed a Bayesian decoder [8] by combining estimated encoding models with a sampled natural movie prior. The decoder provides remarkable reconstructions of the viewed movies. These results demonstrate that dynamic brain activity measured under naturalistic conditions can be decoded using current {fMRI} technology.},

	abstract = {Proper functioning of the neocortex requires a balance between excitation and inhibition. This balance can be achieved through the operation of cortical microcircuits interweaved by excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Since the membrane potentials (Vm) of cortical neurons fluctuate at different levels during cortical activities, it is important to know how the balance of excitation and inhibition is dynamically maintained at different Vm. Recurrent inhibition between excitatory pyramidal cells is mediated by two distinct types of inhibitory interneurons. Here, we show that the amount of recurrent inhibition depends on the Vm levels of presynaptic pyramidal cells. Modest depolarization of a pyramidal cell substantially increases, and sometimes turns on, disynaptic inhibition on its neighboring pyramidal cells. We find that this effect is due to an increase in the strength of synaptic connections from the pyramidal cell to inhibitory interneurons and a consequent elevation of interneuronal firing. The depolarization-induced increase in synaptic strength from the pyramidal cell therefore reflects “analog-mode” signaling in cortical excitatory synapses. We thus reveal a profound impact of analog-mode signaling on the operation of cortical microcircuits and provide a new mechanism for dynamic control of the balance of cortical excitation and inhibition.},

When stimulation intensity was increased in parietal areas, participants believed they had really performed these movements, although no electromyographic activity was detected. Stimulation of the premotor region triggered overt mouth and contralateral limb movements. Yet, patients firmly denied that they had moved.

Using perforated patch-clamp recordings in rat midbrain slices, we isolated Ih in these neurons by voltage clamp. We showed that ethanol reversibly increased the amplitude and accelerated the activation kinetics of Ih and caused a depolarizing shift in its voltage dependence. Using dynamic-clamp conductance injection, we injected artificial Ih and fluctuating {GABAergic} synaptic conductance inputs into neurons following block of intrinsic Ih. This demonstrated directly a major role of Ih in promoting rebound spiking following phasic inhibition, which was enhanced as the kinetics and amplitude of Ih were changed in the manner induced by ethanol. Similar effects of ethanol were observed on Ih and firing rate in non-{DA}, putatively {GABAergic} interneurons, indicating that in addition to its direct effects on firing, ethanol will produce large changes in the inhibition and disinhibition (via {GABAergic} interneurons) converging on {DA} neurons. Thus the overall effects of ethanol on firing of {DA} cells of the {VTA} and {SN} in vivo, and hence on phasic dopamine release in the striatum, appear to be determined substantially by its action on Ih in both {DA} cells and {GABAergic} interneurons.},

Using network dynamics imaging, online reconstruction of functional connectivity, and targeted whole-cell recordings in rats and mice, we found that developing hippocampal networks follow a scale-free topology, and we demonstrated the existence of functional hubs. Perturbation of a single hub influenced the entire network dynamics. Morphophysiological analysis revealed that hub cells are a subpopulation of \{gamma\}-aminobutyric acid-releasing ({GABAergic)} interneurons possessing widespread axonal arborizations.

Our network consists of 383 hierarchically organized regions spanning cortex, thalamus, and basal ganglia; models the presence of 6,602 directed long-distance connections; is three times larger than any previously derived brain network; and contains subnetworks corresponding to classic corticocortical, corticosubcortical, and subcortico-subcortical fiber systems. We found that the empirical degree distribution of the network is consistent with the hypothesis of the maximum entropy exponential distribution and discovered two remarkable bridges between the brain's structure and function via network-theoretical analysis. First, prefrontal cortex contains a disproportionate share of topologically central regions. Second, there exists a tightly integrated core circuit, spanning parts of premotor cortex, prefrontal cortex, temporal lobe, parietal lobe, thalamus, basal ganglia, cingulate cortex, insula, and visual cortex, that includes much of the task-positive and task-negative networks and might play a special role in higher cognition and consciousness.

Localization of large anatomical structures is possible using magnetic resonance imaging or invasive techniques (such as anterograde or retrograde tracing), but identifying patterns in gene expression architecture is limited as gene products do not necessarily identify an immediate functional consequence of a specialized area. Expression of specific genes in the mouse and human cortex is most often identified across entire lamina, and areal patterning of expression (when it exists) is most easily differentiated on a layer-by-layer basis. Since cortical organization is defined by the expression of large sets of genes, the task of identifying individual (or groups of structures) cannot be done using individual areal markers. In this manuscript we describe a methodology for clustering gene expression correlation profiles in the {C57Bl/6J} mouse cortex to identify large-scale genetic relationships between layers and areas. By using the Anatomic Gene Expression Atlas (http://mouse.brain-map.org/agea/) derived from in situ hybridization data in the Allen Brain Atlas, we show that a consistent expression based organization of areal patterning in the mouse cortex exists when clustered on a laminar basis.

	abstract = {Neurons in the primary auditory cortex are tuned to the intensity and specific frequencies of sounds, but the synaptic mechanisms underlying this tuning remain uncertain. Inhibition seems to have a functional role in the formation of cortical receptive fields, because stimuli often suppress similar or neighbouring responses, and pharmacological blockade of inhibition broadens tuning curves. Here we use whole-cell recordings in vivo to disentangle the roles of excitatory and inhibitory activity in the tone-evoked responses of single neurons in the auditory cortex. The excitatory and inhibitory receptive fields cover almost exactly the same areas, in contrast to the predictions of classical lateral inhibition models. Thus, although inhibition is typically as strong as excitation, it is not necessary to establish tuning, even in the receptive field surround. However, inhibition and excitation occurred in a precise and stereotyped temporal sequence: an initial barrage of excitatory input was rapidly quenched by inhibition, truncating the spiking response within a few (1-4) milliseconds. Balanced inhibition might thus serve to increase the temporal precision and thereby reduce the randomness of cortical operation, rather than to increase noise as has been proposed previously.},

	abstract = {The neuronal correlate of perceptual decision making has been extensively studied in the monkey somatosensory system by using a vibrotactile discrimination task, showing that stimulus encoding, retention, and comparison are widely distributed across cortical areas. However, from a network perspective, it is not known what role oscillations play in this task. We recorded local field potentials ({LFPs)} from diverse cortical areas of the sensorimotor system while one monkey performed the vibrotactile discrimination task. Exclusively during stimulus presentation, a periodic response reflecting the stimulus frequency was observed in the somatosensory regions, suggesting that after initial processing, the frequency content of the stimulus is coded in some other way than entrainment. Interestingly, we found that oscillatory activity in the beta band reflected the dynamics of decision making in the monkey sensorimotor network. During the comparison and decision period, beta activity showed a categorical response that reflected the decision of the monkey and distinguished correct from incorrect responses. Importantly, this differential activity was absent in a control condition that involved the same stimulation and response but no decision making required, suggesting it does not merely reflect the maintenance of a motor plan. We conclude that beta band oscillations reflect the temporal and spatial dynamics of the accumulation and processing of evidence in the sensorimotor network leading to the decision outcome.},

	abstract = {Recent experiments have established that information can be encoded in the spike times of neurons relative to the phase of a background oscillation in the local field potential-a phenomenon referred to as "phase-of-firing coding" ({PoFC).} These firing phase preferences could result from combining an oscillation in the input current with a stimulus-dependent static component that would produce the variations in preferred phase, but it remains unclear whether these phases are an epiphenomenon or really affect neuronal interactions-only then could they have a functional role. Here we show that {PoFC} has a major impact on downstream learning and decoding with the now well established spike timing-dependent plasticity ({STDP).} To be precise, we demonstrate with simulations how a single neuron equipped with {STDP} robustly detects a pattern of input currents automatically encoded in the phases of a subset of its afferents, and repeating at random intervals. Remarkably, learning is possible even when only a small fraction of the afferents ( approximately 10\%) exhibits {PoFC.} The ability of {STDP} to detect repeating patterns had been noted before in continuous activity, but it turns out that oscillations greatly facilitate learning. A benchmark with more conventional rate-based codes demonstrates the superiority of oscillations and {PoFC} for both {STDP-based} learning and the speed of decoding: the oscillation partially formats the input spike times, so that they mainly depend on the current input currents, and can be efficiently learned by {STDP} and then recognized in just one oscillation cycle. This suggests a major functional role for oscillatory brain activity that has been widely reported experimentally.},

Channel decorrelation by adaptive mechanisms results in efficient coding, whereas pattern decorrelation facilitates the readout and storage of information. Mechanisms achieving pattern decorrelation, however, remain unclear. We developed a theoretical framework that relates high-dimensional pattern decorrelation to neuronal and circuit properties in a mathematically stringent fashion. For a generic class of random neuronal networks, we proved that pattern decorrelation emerges from neuronal nonlinearities and is amplified by recurrent connectivity. This mechanism does not require adaptation of the network, is enhanced by sparse connectivity, depends on the baseline membrane potential and is robust. Connectivity measurements and computational modeling suggest that this mechanism is involved in pattern decorrelation in the zebrafish olfactory bulb. These results reveal a generic relationship between the structure and function of neuronal circuits that is probably relevant for pattern processing in various brain areas.},

	abstract = {1. Whole-cell and sharp electrode recordings from adult rat dentate gyrus {GCs} were performed in the 400-microns-thick hippocampal slice preparation maintained at 34 +/- 1 degrees C. Intrinsic membrane properties of granule cells ({GCs)} were evaluated with the use of a switching current-clamp amplifier. 2. With the whole-cell technique, the average resting membrane potential ({RMP)} of {GCs} was -85 {mV} when a potassium gluconate electrode solution was used versus -74 {mV} measured with potassium acetate-filled sharp microelectrodes. The membrane voltage response to injected current was linear over two membrane potential ranges, greater than 10 {mV} hyperpolarized from {RMP} and between 10 {mV} more negative than {RMP} and -62 {mV.} The average input resistances ({RN)} calculated over these ranges were 107 and 228 M omega in the whole-cell recordings versus 37 and 54 M omega in the sharp electrode recordings. There was no correlation between {RMP} and {RN} with either recording technique. The membrane time constant (tau m) determined at the {RMP} was 26.9 ms for whole-cell recordings and 13.9 ms for sharp electrode recordings. 3. There was no evidence of time-dependent changes in {RMP}, {RN}, and tau m in whole-cell recordings, although the slow inward rectification seen at hyperpolarized potentials decreased over 30-60 min. Addition of calcium buffers to the whole-cell recording solution did not result in a significant change in the average {RMP}, the average {RN}, or the average tau m. 4. Action potential threshold was comparable in whole-cell (-49 {mV)} and sharp electrode (-52 {mV)} recordings, but action potential amplitude was larger in whole-cell (126 {mV)} than in sharp electrode (106 {mV)} recordings. Spike frequency adaptation was present in the whole-cell recordings and could be abolished by addition of calcium buffers to the electrode solution. 5. We estimated rho, the ratio of dendritic to somatic conductance, to be 5.1 for the whole-cell records and 2.1 for sharp electrode recordings. The electrotonic length of the equivalent cylinder representing the cell processes was estimated to be 0.49 from the whole-cell data and 0.79 from the sharp electrode recordings. This implies that at rest there is only a 10\% decrement in steady-state membrane voltage along the length of the dendrite due to shunting across the membrane resistance; small synaptic events occurring in the distal dendritic tree will therefore have a more substantial influence on the soma than previous analyses suggested.({ABSTRACT} {TRUNCATED} {AT} 400 {WORDS)}},

This paper argues that the original hypothesis was wrong in over-emphasizing the role of compressive coding and economy in neuron numbers, but right in drawing attention to the importance of redundancy. Furthermore there is a clear direction in which it now points, namely to the overwhelming importance of probabilities and statistics in neuroscience. The brain has to decide upon actions in a competitive, chance-driven world, and to do this well it must know about and exploit the non-random probabilities and interdependences of objects and events signalled by sensory messages. These are particularly relevant for Bayesian calculations of the optimum course of action. Instead of thinking of neural representations as transformations of stimulus energies, we should regard them as approximate estimates of the probable truths of hypotheses about the current environment, for these are the quantities required by a probabilistic brain working on Bayesian principles.},

         correlated with properties of the stimuli); however, in general, {PFC} has more task-relevant information, and {ITC} has more
         detailed visual information. Analyses examining how information coded in these areas show that almost all category information is available in a small fraction of the neurons

Martinotti cells ({MCs)} mostly displayed ovoid-shaped somata, bitufted dendritic morphologies, and axons with characteristic spiny boutons projecting to layer I and spreading horizontally across neighbouring columns more than 1 mm. Electron microscopic examination of {MC} boutons revealed that all synapses were symmetrical and most synapses (71\%) were formed onto dendritic shafts. {MCs} were found to contact tuft, apical and basal dendrites in multiple neocortical layers: layer {II/III} {MCs} targeted mostly layer I and to a lesser degree layer {II/III;} layer {IV} {MCs} targeted mostly layer {IV} and to a lesser degree layer I; layer V and {VI} {MCs} targeted mostly layer {IV} and layer I and to a lesser degree the layer in which their somata was located. {MCs} typically displayed spike train accommodation (90\%; n = 127) in response to depolarizing somatic current injections, but some displayed non-accommodating (8\%) and a few displayed irregular spiking responses (2\%). Some accommodating and irregular spiking {MCs} also responded initially with bursts (17\%). Accommodating responses were found in all layers, non-accommodating mostly in upper layers and bursting mostly in layer V. Single-cell multiplex {RT-PCR} performed on 63 {MCs} located throughout layers {II–VI}, revealed that all {MCs} were somatostatin ({SOM)} positive, and negative for parvalbumin ({PV)} as well as vasoactive intestinal peptide ({VIP).} Calbindin ({CB)}, calretinin ({CR)}, neuropeptide Y ({NPY)} and cholecystokinin ({CCK)} were co- expressed with {SOM} in some {MCs.} Some layer-specific trends seem to exist. Finally, 24 accommodating {MCs} were examined for the expression of 26 ion channel genes. The ion channels with the highest expression in these {MCs} were (from highest to lowest); Caβ1, Kv3.3, {HCN4}, Caβ4, Kv3.2, Kv3.1, Kv2.1, {HCN3}, {Caα1G}, Kv3.4, Kv4.2, Kv1.1 and {HCN2.} In summary, this study provides the first detailed analysis of the anatomical, electrophysiological and molecular properties of Martinotti cells located in different neocortical layers. It is proposed that {MCs} are crucial interneurones for feedback inhibition in and between neocortical layers and columns.},

The extracted information is then channeled through a feedforward chain of modules in successively higher visual areas for further analysis. Recent electrophysiological recordings from early visual neurons in awake behaving monkeys reveal that there are many levels of complexity in the information processing of the early visual cortex, as seen in the long-latency responses of its neurons. These new findings suggest that activity in the early visual cortex is tightly coupled and highly interactive with the rest of the visual system. They lead us to propose a new theoretical setting based on the mathematical framework of hierarchical Bayesian inference for reasoning about the visual system. In this framework, the recurrent feedforward/feedback loops in the cortex serve to integrate top-down contextual priors and bottom-up observations so as to implement concurrent probabilistic inference along the visual hierarchy. We suggest that the algorithms of particle filtering and Bayesian-belief propagation might model these interactive cortical computations.

We analysed the neural activity recorded in monkeys during an object sequence memory task to identify a role of mixed selectivity in subserving the cognitive functions ascribed to the {PFC.} We show that mixed selectivity neurons encode distributed information about all task-relevant aspects. Each aspect can be decoded from the population of neurons even when single-cell selectivity to that aspect is eliminated. Moreover, mixed selectivity offers a significant computational advantage over specialized responses in terms of the repertoire of input–output functions implementable by readout neurons. This advantage originates from the highly diverse nonlinear selectivity to mixtures of task-relevant variables, a signature of high-dimensional neural representations. Crucially, this dimensionality is predictive of animal behaviour as it collapses in error trials. Our findings recommend a shift of focus for future studies from neurons that have easily interpretable response tuning to the widely observed, but rarely analysed, mixed selectivity neurons.},

Yet an animal in its natural context, such as searching for food or mates, turns both in response to external stimuli and intrinsic, possibly stochastic, decisions. We show how to estimate the contribution of vision and internal causes on the observable behavior of freely flying Drosophila. We developed a dimensionality reduction scheme that finds a one-dimensional feature of the visual stimulus that best predicts turning decisions. This visual feature extraction is consistent with previous literature on visually elicited fly turning and predicts a large majority of turns in the tested environment. The rarity of stimulus-independent events suggests that fly behavior is more deterministic than previously suggested and that, more generally, animal search strategies may be dominated by responses to stimuli with only modest contributions from internal causes.},

	abstract = {Kv3 channels are thought to be essential for the fast-spiking ({FS)} phenotype in {GABAergic} interneurons, but how these channels confer the ability to generate action potentials ({APs)} at high frequency is unknown. To address this question, we developed a fast dynamic-clamp system (≈50 {kHz)} that allowed us to add a Kv3 model conductance to {CA1} oriens alveus ({OA)} interneurons in hippocampal slices. Selective pharmacological block of Kv3 channels by 0.3 mm4-aminopyridine or 1 mm tetraethylammonium ions led to a marked broadening of {APs} during trains of short stimuli and a reduction in {AP} frequency during 1 sec stimuli. The addition of artificial Kv3 conductance restored the original {AP} pattern. Subtraction of Kv3 conductance by dynamic clamp mimicked the effects of the blockers. Application of artificial Kv3 conductance also led to {FS} in {OA} interneurons after complete K+ channel block and even induced {FS} in hippocampal pyramidal neurons in the absence of blockers. Adding artificial Kv3 conductance with altered deactivation kinetics revealed a nonmonotonic relationship between mean {AP} frequency and deactivation rate, with a maximum slightly above the original value. Insertion of artificial Kv3 conductance with either lowered activation threshold or inactivation also led to a reduction in the mean {AP} frequency. However, the mechanisms were distinct. Shifting the activation threshold induced adaptation, whereas adding inactivation caused frequency-dependent {AP} broadening. In conclusion, Kv3 channels are necessary for the {FS} phenotype of {OA} interneurons, and several of their gating properties appear to be optimized for high-frequency repetitive activity.},

	abstract = {Current metrics for estimating a scientist’s academic performance treat the author’s publications as if these were solely attributable to the author. However, this approach ignores the substantive contributions of co-authors, leading to misjudgments about the individual’s own scientific merits and consequently to misallocation of funding resources and academic positions. This problem is becoming the more urgent in the biomedical field where the number of collaborations is growing rapidly, making it increasingly harder to support the best scientists. Therefore, here we introduce a simple harmonic weighing algorithm for correcting citations and citation-based metrics such as the h-index for co-authorships. This weighing algorithm can account for both the nvumber of co-authors and the sequence of authors on a paper. We then derive a measure called the ‘profit (p)-index’, which estimates the contribution of co-authors to the work of a given author. By using samples of researchers from a renowned Dutch University hospital, Spinoza Prize laureates (the most prestigious Dutch science award), and Nobel Prize laureates in Physiology or Medicine, we show that the contribution of co-authors to the work of a particular author is generally substantial (i.e., about 80\%) and that researchers’ relative rankings change materially when adjusted for the contributions of co-authors. Interestingly, although the top University hospital researchers had the highest h-indices, this appeared to be due to their significantly higher p-indices. Importantly, the ranking completely reversed when using the profit adjusted h-indices, with the Nobel laureates having the highest, the Spinoza Prize laureates having an intermediate, and the top University hospital researchers having the lowest profit adjusted h-indices, respectively, suggesting that exceptional researchers are characterized by a relatively high degree of scientific independency/originality. The concepts and methods introduced here may thus provide a more fair impression of a scientist’s autonomous academic performance.},

	abstract = {Neuronal codes are usually studied by estimating how much information the brain activity carries about the stimulus. On a single cell level, the relevant features of neuronal activity such as the firing rate or spike timing are readily available. On a population level, where many neurons together encode a stimulus property, finding the most appropriate activity features is less obvious, particularly because the neurons respond with a huge cell-to-cell variability. Here, using the example of the neuronal representation of interaural time differences, we show that the quality of the population code strongly depends on the assumption — or the model — of the population readout. We argue that invariances are useful constraints to identify “good” population codes. Based on these ideas, we suggest that the representation of interaural time differences serves a two-channel code in which the difference between the summed activities of the neurons in the two hemispheres exhibits an invariant and linear dependence on interaural time difference.},

Application of unbiased statistical component analyses to genome-scale hippocampal gene expression data revealed robust septotemporal molecular heterogeneity, leading to the identification of a large cohort of genes with robust regionalized hippocampal expression. Manual mapping of heterogeneous {CA3} pyramidal neuron expression patterns demonstrates an unexpectedly complex molecular parcellation into a relatively coherent set of nine expression domains in the septal/temporal and proximal/distal axes with reciprocal, nonoverlapping boundaries. Unique combinatorial profiles of adhesion molecules within these domains suggest corresponding differential connectivity, which is demonstrated for {CA3} projections to the lateral septum using retrograde labeling.

Several genes that were specifically expressed in particular retinal circuit elements, such as inhibitory neuron types, are associated with eye diseases.

	abstract = {Olfactory sensory neurons ({OSNs)} expressing a given odorant receptor ({OR)} gene project their axons to a few specific glomeruli that reside at recognizable locations in the olfactory bulb. Connecting approximately 1000 populations of {OSNs} to the approximately 1800 glomeruli of the mouse bulb poses a formidable wiring problem. Additional progress in understanding the mechanisms of neuronal connectivity is dependent on knowing how these axonal pathways are organized and how they form during development. Here we have applied a genetic approach to this problem. We have constructed by gene targeting novel strains of mice in which either all {OSNs} or those that express a specific {OR} gene, M72 or M71, also produce green fluorescent protein ({GFP)} or a fusion of tau with {GFP.} We visualized {OSNs} and their axons in whole mounts with two-photon laser scanning microscopy. The main conclusion we draw from the three-dimensional reconstructions is the high degree of morphological variability of mature glomeruli receiving axonal input from {OR-expressing} {OSNs} and of the pathways taken by the axons to those glomeruli. We also observe that axons of {OR-expressing} {OSNs} do not innervate nearby glomeruli in mature mice. Postnatally, a tangle of axons from M72-expressing {OSNs} occupies a large surface area of the bulb and coalesces abruptly into a protoglomerulus at a reproducible stage of development. These results differ in several aspects from those reported for the development of glomeruli receiving input from {OSNs} expressing the P2 {OR}, suggesting the need for a more systematic examination of {OR-specific} glomeruli.},

It is also relevant to quantization and lossy source coding theory, since the model provides a form of stochastic signal quantization. Furthermore, it is shown that a bifurcation pattern appears in the optimal threshold distribution as the noise intensity increases.

	abstract = {We present a novel framework for automatically constraining parameters of compartmental models of neurons, given a large set of experimentally measured responses of these neurons. In experiments, intrinsic noise gives rise to a large variability (e.g., in firing pattern) in the voltage responses to repetitions of the exact same input. Thus, the common approach of fitting models by attempting to perfectly replicate, point by point, a single chosen trace out of the spectrum of variable responses does not seem to do justice to the data. In addition, finding a single error function that faithfully characterizes the distance between two spiking traces is not a trivial pursuit. To address these issues, one can adopt a multiple objective optimization approach that allows the use of several error functions jointly. When more than one error function is available, the comparison between experimental voltage traces and model response can be performed on the basis of individual features of interest (e.g., spike rate, spike width). Each feature can be compared between model and experimental mean, in units of its experimental variability, thereby incorporating into the fitting this variability. We demonstrate the success of this approach, when used in conjunction with genetic algorithm optimization, in generating an excellent fit between model behavior and the firing pattern of two distinct electrical classes of cortical interneurons, accommodating and fast-spiking. We argue that the multiple, diverse models generated by this method could serve as the building blocks for the realistic simulation of large neuronal networks.},

	abstract = {The high levels of intelligence seen in humans, other primates, certain cetaceans and birds remain a major puzzle for evolutionary biologists, anthropologists and psychologists. It has long been held that social interactions provide the selection pressures necessary for the evolution of advanced cognitive abilities (the ‘social intelligence hypothesis’), and in recent years decision-making in the context of cooperative social interactions has been conjectured to be of particular importance. Here we use an artificial neural network model to show that selection for efficient decision-making in cooperative dilemmas can give rise to selection pressures for greater cognitive abilities, and that intelligent strategies can themselves select for greater intelligence, leading to a Machiavellian arms race. Our results provide mechanistic support for the social intelligence hypothesis, highlight the potential importance of cooperative behaviour in the evolution of intelligence and may help us to explain the distribution of cooperation with intelligence across taxa.},

	abstract = {The transient oscillatory model of odor identity encoding seeks to explain how odorants with spatially overlapped patterns of input into primary olfactory networks can be discriminated. This model provides several testable predictions about the distributed nature of network oscillations and how they control spike timing. To test these predictions, 16 channel electrode arrays were placed within the antennal lobe ({AL)} of the moth Manduca sexta. Unitary spiking and multi site local field potential ({LFP)} recordings were made during spontaneous activity and in response to repeated presentations of an odor panel. We quantified oscillatory frequency, cross correlations between {LFP} recording sites, and {spike–LFP} phase relationships. We show that odor-driven {AL} oscillations in Manduca are frequency modulating ({FM)} from ∼100 to 30 Hz; this was odorant and stimulus duration dependent. {FM} oscillatory responses were localized to one or two recording sites suggesting a localized (perhaps glomerular) not distributed source. {LFP} cross correlations further demonstrated that only a small (r {\textless} 0.05) distributed and oscillatory component was present. Cross spectral density analysis demonstrated the frequency of these weakly distributed oscillations was state dependent (spontaneous activity = 25–55 Hz; odor-driven = 55–85 Hz). Surprisingly, vector strength analysis indicated that unitary phase locking of spikes to the {LFP} was strongest during spontaneous activity and dropped significantly during responses. Application of bicuculline, a {GABAA} receptor antagonist, significantly lowered the frequency content of odor-driven distributed oscillatory activity. Bicuculline significantly reduced spike phase locking generally, but the ubiquitous pattern of increased phase locking during spontaneous activity persisted. Collectively, these results indicate that oscillations perform poorly as a stimulus-mediated spike synchronizing mechanism for Manduca and hence are incongruent with the transient oscillatory model.},

We show that odor-elicited changes in mitral cell firing rate were larger and more frequently observed in the anesthetized than in the awake condition. Only 27\% of mitral cells that showed a response to odors in the anesthetized state were also odor responsive in the awake state. The amplitude of their response in the awake state was smaller, and some of the responses changed sign compared with their responses in the anesthetized state. The odor representation in the olfactory bulb is therefore sparser in awake behaving mice than in anesthetized preparations. A qualitative explanation of the mechanism responsible for this phenomenon is proposed.},

We show that individuals from different populations carry different profiles of rare and common variants, and that low-frequency variants show substantial geographic differentiation, which is further increased by the action of purifying selection. We show that evolutionary conservation and coding consequence are key determinants of the strength of purifying selection, that rare-variant load varies substantially across biological pathways, and that each individual contains hundreds of rare non-coding variants at conserved sites, such as motif-disrupting changes in transcription-factor-binding sites. This resource, which captures up to 98\% of accessible single nucleotide polymorphisms at a frequency of 1\% in related populations, enables analysis of common and low-frequency variants in individuals from diverse, including admixed, populations.},

We developed linear and non-linear models for decoding the activity of these neurons. We found that the stimuli associated with short-interval patterns of spikes ({ISIs} of 8 ms or less) could be predicted better by second-order models as compared to linear models. Finally, we characterized the difference between these linear and second-order models in a low-dimensional subspace, and showed that modification of the linear models along only a few dimensions improved their predictive power to parity with the second order models. Together these results show that single neurons are capable of using temporal patterns of spikes as fundamental symbols in their neural code, and that they communicate specific stimulus distributions to subsequent neural structures.},

	abstract = {Although the role of myelin-derived Nogo-A as an inhibitor of axonal regeneration after {CNS} injury has been thoroughly described, its physiological function in the adult, uninjured {CNS} is less well known. We address this question in the hippocampus, where Nogo-A is expressed by neurons as well as oligodendrocytes. We used 21 d in vitro slice cultures of neonatal hippocampus where we applied different approaches to interfere with Nogo-A signaling and expression and analyze their effects on the dendritic and axonal architecture of pyramidal cells. Neutralization of Nogo-A by function-blocking antibodies induced a major alteration in the dendrite structure of hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Although spine density was not influenced by Nogo-A neutralization, spine type distribution was shifted toward a more immature phenotype. Axonal complexity and length were greatly increased. Nogo-A {KO} mice revealed a weak dendritic phenotype resembling the effect of the antibody treatment. To discriminate a possible cell-autonomous role of Nogo-A from an environmental, receptor-mediated function, we studied the effects of short hairpin {RNA-induced} knockdown of Nogo-A or {NgR1}, a prominent Nogo-A receptor, within individual neurons. Knockdown of Nogo-A reproduced part of the dendritic and none of the spine or axon alterations. However, downregulation of {NgR1} replicated the dendritic, the axonal, and the spine alterations observed after Nogo-A neutralization. Together, our results demonstrate that Nogo-A plays a major role in stabilizing and maintaining the architecture of hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Mechanistically, although the majority of the activity of Nogo-A relies on a receptor-mediated mechanism involving {NgR1}, its cell-autonomous function plays a minor role.},

Recently, we showed that fear conditioning and extinction alter the intrinsic excitability and bursting of {IL} pyramidal neurons in brain slices. {IL} neurons from Sprague Dawley rats expressing high fear had lower intrinsic excitability and bursting than those from rats expressing low fear, suggesting that regulating the intrinsic excitability and bursting of {IL} neurons would modulate fear expression. To test this, we combined patch-clamp electrophysiology, auditory fear conditioning, and {IL} infusions of M-type K+ channel modulators. Patch-clamp recordings from {IL} neurons showed that the M-type K+ channel blocker, {XE-991}, increased the number of spikes evoked by a depolarizing pulse and reduced the first interspike interval indicating enhanced bursting. To test whether pharmacological enhancement of {IL} excitability and bursting reduces fear expression and facilitates extinction, fear-conditioned rats were infused with {XE-991} into {IL} before extinction training. {XE-infused} rats showed reduced freezing and facilitated extinction compared to vehicle-infused rats. The following day, recall of extinction memory was enhanced. Reducing {IL} excitability and bursting with the M-type K+ channel agonist, flupirtine, had the opposite effect. Flupirtine reduced {IL} spike count and bursting in brain slices. Fear-conditioned rats infused with flupirtine into {IL} before extinction showed significantly higher levels of freezing, indicating that stimulation of M-channels enhanced fear expression. Our findings suggest that the intrinsic excitability and bursting of {IL} neurons regulate fear expression even before extinction.},

A neural interface system1, 2, 3, 4, 5 could restore mobility and independence for people with paralysis by translating neuronal activity directly into control signals for assistive devices. We have previously shown that people with long-standing tetraplegia can use a neural interface system to move and click a computer cursor and to control physical devices6, 7, 8. Able-bodied monkeys have used a neural interface system to control a robotic arm9, but it is unknown whether people with profound upper extremity paralysis or limb loss could use cortical neuronal ensemble signals to direct useful arm actions. Here we demonstrate the ability of two people with long-standing tetraplegia to use neural interface system-based control of a robotic arm to perform three-dimensional reach and grasp movements. Participants controlled the arm and hand over a broad space without explicit training, using signals decoded from a small, local population of motor cortex ({MI)} neurons recorded from a 96-channel microelectrode array. One of the study participants, implanted with the sensor 5 years earlier, also used a robotic arm to drink coffee from a bottle. Although robotic reach and grasp actions were not as fast or accurate as those of an able-bodied person, our results demonstrate the feasibility for people with tetraplegia, years after injury to the central nervous system, to recreate useful multidimensional control of complex devices directly from a small sample of neural signals.},

We found that populations of interneurons in the adult rat hypothalamus switched between dopamine and somatostatin expression in response to exposure to short- and long-day photoperiods. Changes in postsynaptic dopamine receptor expression matched changes in presynaptic dopamine, whereas somatostatin receptor expression remained constant. Pharmacological blockade or ablation of these dopaminergic neurons led to anxious and depressed behavior, phenocopying performance after exposure to the long-day photoperiod. Induction of newly dopaminergic neurons through exposure to the short-day photoperiod rescued the behavioral consequences of lesions. Natural stimulation of other sensory modalities may cause changes in transmitter expression that regulate different behaviors.
Daylight Determines Dopamine
Expression of the appropriate neurotransmitters is essential for the function of neural circuits. Can neurons change their transmitter phenotype to deal with alterations in the environment? Dulcis et al. (p. 449; see the Perspective by Birren and Marder) exposed adult rats to different photoperiods mimicking summer and winter daylengths. Neurotransmitter expression switched between dopamine and somatostatin in hypothalamic neurons that regulate release of corticotropin-releasing factor. Transmitter switching occurred at the transcriptional level and was accompanied by changes in postsynaptic receptors.},

Whether the same neuronal mechanisms mediate spatial attention, which improves perception of attended locations, and nonspatial forms of attention has been a subject of considerable debate. Spatial and feature attention have similar effects on individual neurons. Because visual cortex is retinotopically organized, however, spatial attention can comodulate local neuronal populations, whereas feature attention generally requires more selective modulation. We compared the effects of feature and spatial attention on local and spatially separated populations by recording simultaneously from dozens of neurons in both hemispheres of V4. Feature and spatial attention affect the activity of local populations similarly, modulating both firing rates and correlations between pairs of nearby neurons. However, whereas spatial attention appears to act on local populations, feature attention is coordinated across hemispheres. Our results are consistent with a unified attentional mechanism that can modulate the responses of arbitrary subgroups of neurons.},

Here, we imaged the temporal dynamics of receptor neuron input to the {OB} with a calcium-sensitive dye in the olfactory receptor nerve terminals in anesthetized mice. We found that diverse, glomerulus- and odorant-dependent temporal dynamics are present even at this initial input stage. Instantaneous spatial patterns of receptor input to glomeruli changed both within and between respiration cycles. Glomerular odorant responses differed in amplitude, latency, rise time, and degree of modulation by sniffing in an odorant-specific manner. Pattern dynamics within the first respiration cycle recurred in a similar manner during consecutive cycles. When sniff rate was increased artificially, pattern dynamics were preserved in the first sniff but were attenuated during subsequent sniffs. Temporal response properties were consistent across individuals on a coarse regional scale and on a fine scale of individual glomeruli. Latency and magnitude of glomerular inputs were only weakly correlated and might therefore convey independent odorant information. These data demonstrate that glomerular maps of primary sensory input to the {OB} are temporally dynamic. These dynamics may contribute to the representation of odorant information and affect information processing in the central olfactory system of rodents.},

These channels included a fast and persistent Na+ channel, three voltage-dependent K+ channels, T-type and P-type Ca2+ channels, and two types of Ca(2+)-activated K+ channels. 2. The ionic channels were distributed differentially over three zones of the model, with Na+ channels in the soma, fast K+ channels in the soma and main dendrite, and Ca2+ channels and Ca(2+)-activated K+ channels in the entire dendrite. Channel densities in the model were varied until it could reproduce Purkinje cell responses to current injections in the soma or dendrite, as observed in slice recordings. 3. As in real Purkinje cells, the model generated two types of spiking behavior. In response to small current injections the model fired exclusively fast somatic spikes. These somatic spikes were caused by Na+ channels and repolarized by the delayed rectifier. When higher-amplitude current injections were given, sodium spiking increased in frequency until the model generated large dendritic Ca2+ spikes. Analysis of membrane currents underlying this behavior showed that these Ca2+ spikes were caused by the P-type Ca2+ channel and repolarized by the {BK-type} Ca(2+)-activated K+ channel. As in pharmacological blocking experiments, removal of Na+ channels abolished the fast spikes and removal of Ca2+ channels removed Ca2+ spiking. 4. In addition to spiking behavior, the model also produced slow plateau potentials in both the dendrite and soma. These longer-duration potentials occurred in response to both short and prolonged current steps. Analysis of the model demonstrated that the plateau potentials in the soma were caused by the window current component of the fast Na+ current, which was much larger than the current through the persistent Na+ channels. Plateau potentials in the dendrite were carried by the same P-type Ca2+ channel that was also responsible for Ca2+ spike generation. The P channel could participate in both model functions because of the low-threshold K2-type Ca(2+)-activated K+ channel, which dynamically changed the threshold for dendritic spike generation through a negative feedback loop with the activation kinetics of the P-type Ca2+ channel. 5. These model responses were robust to changes in the densities of all of the ionic channels.({ABSTRACT} {TRUNCATED} {AT} 400 {WORDS)}},

Information about stimulus identity was somewhat reduced in single A1 and {MGB} neurons relative to single {IC} neurons, when information is measured using spike counts, latency, or temporal spiking patterns. However, most of this difference was due to differences in firing rates. On the other hand, {IC} neurons were substantially more redundant than A1 and {MGB} neurons. {IC} redundancy was largely related to frequency selectivity. Redundancy reduction may be a generic organization principle of neural systems, allowing for easier readout of the identity of complex stimuli in A1 relative to {IC.}},

Here we use calcium imaging in an olfactory bulb-cortex slice preparation to provide direct evidence that neurons in piriform cortex receive convergent synaptic input from different glomeruli. We show that the combined activity of distinct glomerular pathways recruits ensembles of pyramidal cells that are not activated by the individual pathways alone. This cooperative recruitment of cortical neurons only occurs over a narrow time window and is a feature intrinsic to the olfactory cortex that can be explained by the integration of converging, subthreshold synaptic input. Cooperative recruitment enhances the differences between cortical representations of partially overlapping input patterns and may contribute to the initial steps of olfactory discrimination.},

Others may wish to mine these data for new discoveries and innovations. However, research data are not readily available as sharing is common in only a few fields such as astronomy and genomics. Data sharing practices in other fields vary widely. Moreover, research data take many forms, are handled in many ways, using many approaches, and often are difficult to interpret once removed from their initial context. Data sharing is thus a conundrum. Four rationales for sharing data are examined, drawing examples from the sciences, social sciences, and humanities: (1) to reproduce or to verify research, (2) to make results of publicly funded research available to the public, (3) to enable others to ask new questions of extant data, and (4) to advance the state of research and innovation. These rationales differ by the arguments for sharing, by beneficiaries, and by the motivations and incentives of the many stakeholders involved. The challenges are to understand which data might be shared, by whom, with whom, under what conditions, why, and to what effects. Answers will inform data policy and practice.},

Mitral cells within a single odorant receptor-specific network can be synchronized by dendrodendritic excitatory interactions in a glomerulus, whereas mitral cells in different networks engage in long-lasting lateral inhibition mediated by dendrodendritic synapses with interneurons. The emerging picture is one in which groups of mitral cells use a unique set of mechanisms to accomplish computational functions similar to those performed by analogous modular structures in other sensory systems.},

The highly specialized intrinsic membrane and firing properties that allow cortical {FS} interneurons to perform these functions are attributable to equally specialized gene expression, which is ultimately coordinated by cell-type-specific transcriptional regulation. Although embryonic transcriptional events govern the initial steps of cell-type specification in most cortical interneurons, including {FS} cells, the electrophysiological properties that distinguish adult cortical cell types emerge relatively late in postnatal development, and the transcriptional events that drive this maturational process are not known. To address this, we used mouse whole-genome microarrays and whole-cell patch clamp to characterize the transcriptional and electrophysiological maturation of cortical {FS} interneurons between postnatal day 7 (P7) and P40. We found that the intrinsic and synaptic physiology of {FS} cells undergoes profound regulation over the first 4 postnatal weeks and that these changes are correlated with primarily monotonic but bidirectional transcriptional regulation of thousands of genes belonging to multiple functional classes. Using our microarray screen as a guide, we discovered that upregulation of two-pore K+ leak channels between P10 and P25 contributes to one of the major differences between the intrinsic membrane properties of immature and adult {FS} cells and found a number of other candidate genes that likely confer cell-type specificity on mature {FS} cells.},

We recorded inhibitory and excitatory currents evoked during a single sniff-like odor presentation in granule cells in vivo. We found that synaptic excitation was extensively activated across cells, whereas phasic inhibition was rare. Further, our analysis indicates that {GCs} are innervated by a persistent firing of deep short axon cell ({dSAC)} that mediated the inhibitory evoked responses. Blockade of {GABAergic} synaptic input onto granule cells revealed a tonic inhibitory current mediated by furosemide-sensitive {GABAA} receptors. The average current associated with this tonic {GABAergic} conductance was three-fold larger than that of phasic {IPSCs.} We show that the pharmacological blockage of tonic inhibition markedly increased the occurrence of supra-threshold responses during an odor-stimulated sniff.

We found the cell's firing rate could be predicted by a simple formula that maps the physical components of the cell onto those of an abstract two-layer "neural network." In the first layer, synaptic inputs drive independent sigmoidal subunits corresponding to the cell's several dozen long, thin terminal dendrites. The subunit outputs are then summed within the main trunk and cell body prior to final thresholding. We conclude that insofar as the neural code is mediated by average firing rate, a two-layer neural network may provide a useful abstraction for the computing function of the individual pyramidal neuron.},

connections to some related standard statistical methods, including spline smoothing and isotonic regression. Finally, we
note that the computational methods reviewed here do not in fact depend on the state-space setting at all; instead, the key

	abstract = {Humans vary in their ability to smell numerous odors [1,2,3], including those associated with food [4,5,6]. Odor sensitivity is heritable [7,8,9,10,11], with examples linking genetic variation for sensitivity to specific odors typically located near olfactory receptor ({OR)} genes [12,13,14,15,16]. However, with thousands of aromas and few deorphaned {ORs} [17,18], there has been little progress toward linking variation at {OR} loci to odor sensitivity [19,20]. We hypothesized that {OR} genes contain the variation that explains much of the differences in sensitivity for odors, paralleling the genetics of taste [21,22], which affect the flavor experience of foods [23,24,25]. We employed a genome-wide association approach for ten food-related odors and identified genetic associations to sensitivity for 2-heptanone (p = 5.1 × 10−8), isobutyraldehyde (p = 6.4 × 10−10), β-damascenone (p = 1.6 × 10−7), and β-ionone (p = 1.4 × 10−31). Each locus is located in/near distinct clusters of {OR} genes. These findings increase the number of olfactory sensitivity loci to nine and demonstrate the importance of {OR-associated} variation in sensory acuity for food-related odors. Analysis of genotype frequencies across human populations implies that variation in sensitivity for these odors is widespread. Furthermore, each participant possessed one of many possible combinations of sensitivities for these odors, supporting the notion that everyone experiences their own unique “flavor world.”},

	abstract = {Brain damage causes multiple changes in synaptic function and intrinsic properties of surviving neurons, leading to the development of chronic epilepsy. In the widely used pilocarpine-status epilepticus ({SE)} rat model of temporal lobe epilepsy ({TLE)}, a major alteration is the marked increase in the fraction of intrinsically bursting {CA1} pyramidal cells. Here we have differentiated between two types of bursting phenotypes: 1) bursting in response to threshold-straddling excitatory current pulses (low-threshold bursting) and 2) bursting only in response to suprathreshold stimuli (high-threshold bursting). Low-threshold bursting prevailed in 46.5\% of {SE-experienced} neurons sampled 1-4 wk after pilocarpine-{SE}, but was rarely seen in control neurons (1.9\%). As previously shown, it appeared to be driven predominantly by a T-type Ca(2+) current (I({CaT))} in the apical dendrites. After blocking low-threshold bursting with Ni(2+), the same neurons still manifested a high-threshold bursting phenotype. Another 40.1\% of {SE-experienced} neurons displayed only a high-threshold bursting phenotype and the remaining 13.4\% of these neurons were nonbursters. Altogether, high-threshold bursting prevailed in 86.6\% of {SE-experienced} neurons, but only in 33.0\% of control neurons. Several lines of evidence indicated that high-threshold bursting is driven by persistent Na(+) current (I({NaP))} at or near the soma. Congruently, I({NaP)} was 1.5-fold larger in {SE-experienced} versus control neurons. We conclude that an increase in I({NaP)}, conjointly with an increase in I({CaT)}, strongly contributes to the predominance of bursting phenotypes in {CA1} pyramidal cells early after pilocarpine-{SE} and thus likely plays a role in the development of a chronic epileptic condition in this {TLE} model.},

Since Cajal, the neuron remains a fundamental unit of the nervous system, yet even with the explosion of information technology, we still have few comprehensive or systematic strategies for aggregating cell-level knowledge. Progress toward this goal is hampered by the multiplicity of names for cells and by lack of a consensus on the criteria for defining neuron types. However, through umbrella projects like the Neuroscience Information Framework ({NIF)} and the International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility ({INCF)}, we have the opportunity to propose and implement an informatics infrastructure for establishing common tools and approaches to describe neurons through a standard terminology for nerve cells and a database (a Neuron Registry) where these descriptions can be deposited and compared. This article provides an overview of the problem and outlines a solution approach utilizing ontological characterizations. Based on illustrative implementation examples, we also discuss the need for consensus criteria to be adopted by the research community, and considerations on future developments. A scalable repository of neuron types will provide researchers with a resource that materially contributes to the advancement of neuroscience.},

Many cause paroxysmal disturbances of brain, spinal cord, peripheral nerve or skeletal muscle function, with normal neurological development and function in between attacks. To fully understand how mutations of ion channel genes cause disease, we need to know the normal location and function of the channel subunit, consequences of the mutation for biogenesis and biophysical properties, and possible compensatory changes in other channels that contribute to cell or circuit excitability. Animal models of monogenic channelopathies increasingly help our understanding. An important challenge for the future is to determine how more subtle derangements of ion channel function, which arise from the interaction of genetic and environmental influences, contribute to common paroxysomal disorders, including idiopathic epilepsy and migraine, that share features with rare monogenic channelopathies.},

	abstract = {The acquisition of sensory information during behavior shapes the neural representation, central processing, and perception of external stimuli. In mammals, a sniff represents the basic unit of odor sampling, yet how sniffing shapes odor representations remains poorly understood. Perhaps the earliest hypothesis of the role of sniffing in olfaction arises from the fact that odorants with different physicochemical properties exhibit different patterns of deposition across the olfactory epithelium, and that these patterns are differentially affected by flow rate. However, whether sniff flow rates shape odor representations during natural sniffing remains untested, and whether animals make use of odorant sorption–airflow relationships as part of an active odor-sampling strategy remains unclear. We tested these ideas in the intact rat using a threefold approach. First, we asked whether sniff strength shapes odor representations in vivo by imaging from olfactory receptor neuron ({ORN)} terminals during controlled changes in inhalation flow in the anesthetized rat. Second, we asked whether sniff strength shapes odor representations by imaging from {ORNs} during natural sniffing in the awake rat. Third, we asked whether rats actively modulate sniff strength during an odor discrimination task. We found that, while artificial changes in flow rate can alter {ORN} responses, sniff strength has negligible effect on odor representations during natural sniffing, and behaving rats do not modulate flow rate to improve odor discrimination. These data suggest that modulating sniff strength does not shape odor representations sufficiently to be part of a strategy for active odor sensing in the behaving animal.},

In nucleated patches isolated from basket cells of the dentate gyrus, a fast delayed rectifier K+ current component that was highly sensitive to tetraethylammonium ({TEA)} and 4-aminopyridine (4-{AP)} (half-maximal inhibitory concentrations {\textless}0.1 {mM)} predominated, contributing an average of 58\% to the total K+ current in these cells. By contrast, in pyramidal neurons of the {CA1} region a rapidly inactivating A-type K+ current component that was {TEA-resistant} prevailed, contributing 61\% to the total K+ current. Both types of neurons also showed small amounts of the K+ current component mainly found in the other type of neuron and, in addition, a slow delayed rectifier K+ current component with intermediate properties (slow inactivation, intermediate sensitivity to {TEA).} Single-cell {RT-PCR} analysis of {mRNA} revealed that Kv3 (Kv3.1, Kv3.2) subunit transcripts were expressed in almost all (89\%) of the interneurons but only in 17\% of the pyramidal neurons. In contrast, Kv4 (Kv4.2, Kv4.3) subunit {mRNAs} were present in 87\% of pyramidal neurons but only in 55\% of interneurons. Selective block of fast delayed rectifier K+ channels, presumably assembled from Kv3 subunits, by 4-{AP} reduced substantially the action potential frequency in interneurons. These results indicate that the differential expression of Kv3 and Kv4 subunits shapes the action potential phenotypes of principal neurons and interneurons in the cortex.},

This holds for arbitrary correlations, any tuning curves, continuous and discrete variables, and sensory evidence whose reliability varies over time. Our model predicts that the neurons in the lateral intraparietal cortex involved in evidence accumulation encode, on every trial, a probability distribution which predicts the animal's performance.

Essential to this process is the formation of abstract representations that generalize from specific instances of visual input. A common view holds that neurons in the early visual system signal conjunctions of image features, but how these produce invariant representations is poorly understood. Here we propose that to generalize over similar images, higher-level visual neurons encode statistical variations that characterize local image regions. We present a model in which neural activity encodes the probability distribution most consistent with a given image. Trained on natural images, the model generalizes by learning a compact set of dictionary elements for image distributions typically encountered in natural scenes. Model neurons show a diverse range of properties observed in cortical cells. These results provide a new functional explanation for nonlinear effects in complex cells and offer insight into coding strategies in primary visual cortex (V1) and higher visual areas.},

Using a nonlinear modeling framework applied to extracellular data, we demonstrate that the precise timing of thalamic spike trains can be explained by the interplay between an excitatory input and a delayed suppressive input that resembles inhibition, such that neuronal responses only occur in brief windows where excitation exceeds suppression. The resulting description of thalamic computation resembles earlier models of contrast adaptation, suggesting a more general role for mechanisms of contrast adaptation in visual processing. Thus, we describe a more complex computation underlying thalamic responses to artificial and natural stimuli that has implications for understanding how visual information is represented in the early stages of visual processing.},

	abstract = {Spatial gene expression profiles provide a novel means of exploring the structural organization of the brain. Computational analysis of these patterns is made possible by genome-scale mapping of the {C57BL/6J} mouse brain in the Allen Brain Atlas. Here we describe methodology used to explore the spatial structure of gene expression patterns across a set of 3041 genes chosen on the basis of consistency across experimental observations (N=2). The analysis was performed on smoothed, co-registered {3D} expression volumes for each gene obtained by aggregating cellular resolution image data. Following dimensionality and noise reduction, voxels were clustered according to similarity of expression across the gene set. We illustrate the resulting parcellations of the mouse brain for different numbers of clusters (K) and quantitatively compare these parcellations with a classically-defined anatomical reference atlas at different levels of granularity, revealing a high degree of correspondence. These observations suggest that spatial localization of gene expression offers substantial promise in connecting knowledge at the molecular level with higher-level information about brain organization.},

	abstract = {Efficient sensory coding implies that populations of neurons should represent information-rich aspects of a signal with little redundancy (Barlow 1961). Recent studies have demonstrated that neural heterogeneity in higher brain areas enhances the efficiency of encoding by reducing redundancy across the population (Chelaru and Dragoi 2008; Osborne et al. 2008; Shamir and Sompolinsky 2006). Here, we investigate how neural heterogeneity in the early stages of sensory processing influences the efficiency of population codes. Through the analysis of in vivo recordings, we contrast the encoding of two types of communication signals of electric fishes in the most peripheral sensory area of the {CNS}, the Electrosensory Lateral Line lobe ({ELL).} We show that communication signals used during courtship (big chirps) and during aggressive encounters (small chirps) are encoded by different populations of {ELL} pyramidal cells, namely I-cells and E-cells respectively. Most importantly we show that the encoding strategy differs for the two signals and we argue that these differences allow these cell types to encode specifically information-rich features of the signals. Small chirps are detected and their timing is accurately signaled through stereotyped spike bursts, whereas the shape of big chirps is accurately represented by variable increases in firing rate. Furthermore, we show that the heterogeneity across I-cells enhances the efficiency of the population code and thus permits the accurate discrimination of different quality courtship signals. Our study demonstrates the importance of neural heterogeneity early in a sensory system and that it initiates the sparsification of sensory representation thereby contributing to the efficiency of the neural code.},

This paper describes the use of the Web Ontology Language ({OWL)} and other Semantic Web technologies for the representation and integration of molecular-level data provided by several of {SenseLab} suite of neuroscience databases.
{METHODS:} Based on the original database structure, we semi-automatically translated the databases into {OWL} ontologies with manual addition of semantic enrichment. The {SenseLab} ontologies are extensively linked to other biomedical Semantic Web resources, including the Subcellular Anatomy Ontology, Brain Architecture Management System, the Gene Ontology, {BIRNLex} and {UniProt.} The {SenseLab} ontologies have also been mapped to the Basic Formal Ontology and Relation Ontology, which helps ease interoperability with many other existing and future biomedical ontologies for the Semantic Web. In addition, approaches to representing contradictory research statements are described. The {SenseLab} ontologies are designed for use on the Semantic Web that enables their integration into a growing collection of biomedical information resources.
{CONCLUSION:} We demonstrate that our approach can yield significant potential benefits and that the Semantic Web is rapidly becoming mature enough to realize its anticipated promises. The ontologies are available online at http://neuroweb.med.yale.edu/senselab/.},

Even cells within the same functional column are known to have highly heterogeneous response properties when the same stimulus is presented. Whether the wide diversity of neuronal responses is an epiphenomenon or plays a role for cortical function is unknown. Here, we examined the relationship between the heterogeneity of neuronal responses and population coding. Contrary to our expectation, we found that the high variability of intrinsic response properties of individual cells changes the structure of neuronal correlations to improve the information encoded in the population activity. Thus, the heterogeneity of neuronal responses is in fact beneficial for sensory coding when stimuli are decoded from the population response.},

Here we optically imaged the spatial and temporal activity patterns of neuronal populations in mice performing a {PPC-dependent} task that combined a perceptual decision and memory-guided navigation in a virtual environment. Individual neurons had transient activation staggered relative to one another in time, forming a sequence of neuronal activation spanning the entire length of a task trial. Distinct sequences of neurons were triggered on trials with opposite behavioural choices and defined divergent, choice-specific trajectories through a state space of neuronal population activity. Cells participating in the different sequences and at distinct time points in the task were anatomically intermixed over microcircuit length scales ({\textless}100 micrometres). During working memory decision tasks, the {PPC} may therefore perform computations through sequence-based circuit dynamics, rather than long-lived stable states, implemented using anatomically intermingled microcircuits.},

	abstract = {Many social animals including songbirds use communication vocalizations for individual recognition. The perception of vocalizations depends on the encoding of complex sounds by neurons in the ascending auditory system, each of which is tuned to a particular subset of acoustic features. Here, we examined how well the responses of single auditory neurons could be used to discriminate among bird songs and we compared discriminability to spectrotemporal tuning. We then used biologically realistic models of pooled neural responses to test whether the responses of groups of neurons discriminated among songs better than the responses of single neurons and whether discrimination by groups of neurons was related to spectrotemporal tuning and trial-to-trial response variability. The responses of single auditory midbrain neurons could be used to discriminate among vocalizations with a wide range of abilities, ranging from chance to 100\%. The ability to discriminate among songs using single neuron responses was not correlated with spectrotemporal tuning. Pooling the responses of pairs of neurons generally led to better discrimination than the average of the two inputs and the most discriminating input. Pooling the responses of three to five single neurons continued to improve neural discrimination. The increase in discriminability was largest for groups of neurons with similar spectrotemporal tuning. Further, we found that groups of neurons with correlated spike trains achieved the largest gains in discriminability. We simulated neurons with varying levels of temporal precision and measured the discriminability of responses from single simulated neurons and groups of simulated neurons. Simulated neurons with biologically observed levels of temporal precision benefited more from pooling correlated inputs than did neurons with highly precise or imprecise spike trains. These findings suggest that pooling correlated neural responses with the levels of precision observed in the auditory midbrain increases neural discrimination of complex vocalizations.},

	abstract = {Dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area ({VTA)} fire spontaneously in a pacemaker-like manner. We analyzed the ionic currents that drive pacemaking in dopaminergic {VTA} neurons, studied in mouse brain slices. Pacemaking was not inhibited by blocking hyperpolarization-activated cation current (Ih) or blocking all calcium current by Mg2+ replacement of Ca2+. Tetrodotoxin ({TTX)} stopped spontaneous activity and usually resulted in stable resting potentials near −60 {mV} to −55 {mV}, 10–15 {mV} below the action potential threshold. When external sodium was replaced by N-methyl-d-glucamine ({NMDG)} with {TTX} present, cells hyperpolarized by an average of −11 {mV}, suggesting a significant resting sodium conductance not sensitive to {TTX.} Voltage-clamp experiments using slow (10 {mV/s)} ramps showed a steady-state, steeply voltage-dependent current blocked by {TTX} that activates near −60 {mV}, as well as a sodium “background” current with little voltage sensitivity, revealed by {NMDG} replacement for sodium with {TTX} present. We quantified these two components of sodium current during the pacemaking trajectory using action potential clamp. The initial phase of depolarization, up to approximately −55 {mV}, is driven mainly by non-voltage-dependent sodium background current. Above −55 {mV}, {TTX-sensitive} voltage-dependent “persistent” Na current helps drive the final phase of depolarization to the spike threshold. Voltage-dependent calcium current is small at all subthreshold voltages. The pacemaking mechanism in {VTA} neurons differs from that in substantia nigra pars compacta ({SNc)} neurons, where subthreshold calcium current plays a dominant role. In addition, we found that non-voltage-dependent background sodium current is much smaller in {SNc} neurons than {VTA} neurons.},

	abstract = {In the cat or primate primary visual cortex (V1), normal vision corresponds to a state where neural excitation patterns are driven by external visual stimuli. A spectacular failure mode of V1 occurs when such patterns are overwhelmed by spontaneously generated spatially self-organized patterns of neural excitation. These are experienced as geometric visual hallucinations. The problem of identifying the mechanisms by which V1 avoids this failure is made acute by recent advances in the statistical mechanics of pattern formation, which suggest that the hallucinatory state should be very robust. Here, we report how incorporating physiologically realistic long-range connections between inhibitory neurons changes the behavior of a model of V1. We find that the sparsity of long-range inhibition in V1 plays a previously unrecognized but key functional role in preserving the normal vision state. Surprisingly, it also contributes to the observed regularity of geometric visual hallucinations. Our results provide an explanation for the observed sparsity of long-range inhibition in V1—this generic architectural feature is an evolutionary adaptation that tunes V1 to the normal vision state. In addition, it has been shown that exactly the same long-range connections play a key role in the development of orientation preference maps. Thus V1’s most striking long-range features—patchy excitatory connections and sparse inhibitory connections—are strongly constrained by two requirements: the need for the visual state to be robust and the developmental requirements of the orientational preference map.},

The resulting approach has several useful properties, namely, (1) it recovers a set of linear filters sorted according to their informativeness about the neural response; (2) it is both computationally efficient and robust, allowing recovery of multiple linear filters from a data set of relatively modest size; (3) it provides an explicit "default" model of the nonlinear stage mapping the filter responses to spike rate, in the form of a ratio of Gaussians; (4) it is equivalent to maximum likelihood estimation of this default model but also converges to the correct filter estimates whenever the conditions for the consistency of {STA} or {STC} analysis are met; and (5) it can be augmented with additional constraints on the filters, such as space-time separability.

The first contribution of this paper is to endow spike train space with a parameterized family of metrics that takes into account different time warpings and generalizes several currently used metrics. These metrics are essentially penalized L(p) norms, involving appropriate functions of spike trains, with penalties associated with time-warpings. The second contribution of this paper is to derive a notion of a mean spike train in the case when p=2. We present an efficient recursive algorithm, termed Matching-Minimization algorithm, to compute the sample mean of a set of spike trains.

	abstract = {In the compound lateral eye of Limulus each ommatidium functions as a single receptor unit in the discharge of impulses in the optic nerve. Impulses originate in the eccentric cell of each ommatidium and are conducted in its axon, which runs without interruption through an extensive plexus of nerve fibers to become a fiber of the optic nerve. The plexus makes interconnections among the ommatidia, but its exact organization is not {understood.The} ability of an ommatidium to discharge impulses in the axon of its eccentric cell is reduced by illumination of other ommatidia in its neighborhood: the threshold to light is raised, the number of impulses discharged in response to a suprathreshold flash of light is diminished, and the frequency with which impulses are discharged during steady illumination is decreased. Also, the activity that can be elicited under certain conditions when an ommatidium is in darkness can be inhibited similarly. There is no evidence for the spread of excitatory influences in the eye of {Limulus.The} inhibitory influence exerted upon an ommatidium that is discharging impulses at a steady rate begins, shortly after the onset of the illumination on neighboring ommatidia, with a sudden deep minimum in the frequency of discharge. After partial recovery, the frequency is maintained at a depressed level until the illumination on the neighboring receptors is turned off, following which there is prompt, though not instantaneous recovery to the original {frequency.The} inhibition is exerted directly upon the sensitive structure within the ommatidium: it has been observed when the impulses were recorded by a microelectrode thrust into an ommatidium, as well as when they were recorded more proximally in single fibers dissected from the optic {nerve.Receptor} units of the eye often inhibit one another mutually. This has been observed by recording the activity of two optic nerve fibers {simultaneously.The} mediation of the inhibitory influence appears to depend upon the integrity of nervous interconnections in the plexus: cutting the lateral connections to an ommatidium abolishes the inhibition exerted upon it. The nature of the influence that is mediated by the plexus and the mechanism whereby it exerts its inhibitory action on the receptor units are not {known.The} depression of the frequency of the discharge of nerve impulses from an ommatidium increases approximately linearly with the logarithm of the intensity of illumination on receptors in its {vicinity.Inhibition} of the discharge from an ommatidium is greater the larger the area of the eye illuminated in its vicinity. However, equal increments of area become less effective as the total area is {increased.The} response of an ommatidium is most effectively inhibited by the illumination of ommatidia that are close to it; the effectiveness diminishes with increasing distance, but may extend for several {millimeters.Illumination} of a fixed region of the eye at constant intensity produces a depression of the frequency of discharge of impulses from a nearby ommatidium that is approximately constant, irrespective of the level of excitation of the {ommatidium.The} inhibitory interaction in the eye of Limulus is an integrative process that is important in determining the patterns of nervous activity in the visual system. It is analogous to the inhibitory component of the interaction that takes place in the vertebrate retina. Inhibitory interaction results in the exaggeration of differences in sensory activity from different regions of the eye illuminated at different intensities, thus enhancing visual contrast.},

By comparing the information carried by a compound pattern with the information carried independently by its parts, we directly measure the synergy among these parts. We illustrate the use of these methods by applying them to experiments on the motion-sensitive neuron H1 of the fly's visual system, where we confirm that two spikes close together in time carry far more than twice the information carried by a single spike. We analyze the sources of this synergy and provide evidence that pairs of spikes close together in time may be especially important patterns in the code of H1.},

	abstract = {The ability to computationally extract mentions of neuroanatomical regions from the literature would assist linking to other entities within and outside of an article. Examples include extracting reports of connectivity or region-specific gene expression. To facilitate text mining of neuroscience literature we have created a corpus of manually annotated brain region mentions. The corpus contains 1,377 abstracts with 18,242 brain region annotations. Interannotator agreement was evaluated for a subset of the documents, and was 90.7\% and 96.7\% for strict and lenient matching respectively. We observed a large vocabulary of over 6,000 unique brain region terms and 17,000 words. For automatic extraction of brain region mentions we evaluated simple dictionary methods and complex natural language processing techniques. The dictionary methods based on neuroanatomical lexicons recalled 36\% of the mentions with 57\% precision. The best performance was achieved using a conditional random field ({CRF)} with a rich feature set. Features were based on morphological, lexical, syntactic and contextual information. The {CRF} recalled 76\% of mentions at 81\% precision, by counting partial matches recall and precision increase to 86\% and 92\% respectively. We suspect a large amount of error is due to coordinating conjunctions, previously unseen words and brain regions of less commonly studied organisms. We found context windows, lemmatization and abbreviation expansion to be the most informative techniques. The corpus is freely available at {http://www.chibi.ubc.ca/WhiteText/}

	abstract = {Changes in the arborization and electrical excitability of the apical dendritic tufts of pyramidal cells of cortical layer 5 were examined during the first 2 months (postnatal days (P)2-56) of postnatal development in rats. Reconstructions of biocytin-filled neurons showed that the apical dendritic trunk was continually growing, becoming longer and thicker and that the distance between the tuft and soma increased more than 5-fold. In P2 animals, both the tuft and soma had a high input resistance ({\textgreater} 500 {MOmega)} and the tuft was electrotonically close to the soma. In contrast, the apical tuft and soma of P56 neurons had a low input resistance ({\textless} 50 {MOmega)} and they were electrotonically isolated from each other. Depolarizing current pulses injected into the tuft of P2 cells generated mostly Na+-dependent regenerative dendritic potentials of short duration ( approximately 15 ms) while in the tuft of P56 animals, complex regenerative potentials were generated which had a longer duration ( approximately 55 ms) and were Na+ and Ca2+ dependent. In young and juvenile animals (P14-28) dendritic regenerative potentials could be restricted to the apical dendritic tuft whereas in adult animals ({\textgreater} P42), the complex regenerative potentials frequently occurred simultaneously with somatic action potentials. The main developmental change in layer 5 pyramidal neurons, as assayed with square pulse current injections and synaptic stimulations, is the progressive electrotonic isolation of the dendritic tuft from the soma. This change is concomitant with the appearance of complex, mostly Na+- and Ca2+-dependent, regenerative dendritic potentials initiated partly in the tuft and partly in the axon. The coupling of the dendritic tuft and axonal initiation zones for regenerative potentials by active dendritic Na+ and Ca2+ conductances enables mature layer 5 pyramidal neurons to detect selectively the salient distal synaptic inputs and coincident synaptic inputs arriving at different cortical layers.},

Many studies have examined the effect of a stimulus on the mean response, but few have examined the effect on response variability. We measured neural variability in 13 extracellularly recorded datasets and one intracellularly recorded dataset from seven areas spanning the four cortical lobes in monkeys and cats. In every case, stimulus onset caused a decline in neural variability. This occurred even when the stimulus produced little change in mean firing rate. The variability decline was observed in membrane potential recordings, in the spiking of individual neurons and in correlated spiking variability measured with implanted 96-electrode arrays. The variability decline was observed for all stimuli tested, regardless of whether the animal was awake, behaving or anaesthetized. This widespread variability decline suggests a rather general property of cortex, that its state is stabilized by an input.},

Here we introduce an idea for the gating of multiple signals in cortical networks that combines principles of signal propagation with aspects of balanced networks. Specifically, we studied networks in which incoming excitatory signals are normally cancelled by locally evoked inhibition, leaving the targeted layer unresponsive. Transmission can be gated 'on' by modulating excitatory and inhibitory gains to upset this detailed balance. We illustrate gating through detailed balance in large networks of integrate-and-fire neurons. We show successful gating of multiple signals and study failure modes that produce effects reminiscent of clinically observed pathologies. Provided that the individual signals are detectable, detailed balance has a large capacity for gating multiple signals.},
